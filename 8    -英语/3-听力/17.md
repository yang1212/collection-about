You are an insightful young lady.   
I don’t know what that means, but thank you.   
It means perceptive.   
You see things most people miss.   
My name is Missy, —go figure.   
Have you always been that way?   
I guess so, I think when you’re on your own a lot.   
You get good at seeing that kind of stuff.   
Really?   
My dad does football with my older brother.   
So they’re like a team.   
And my mom and meemaw spend all their time fussing over Sheldon.   
So they’re like a team. Too.   
So no one’s on your team?   
Nope.   
It’s just me.   
Oh, Lord.
