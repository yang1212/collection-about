You were gone so long.     
How did it go?     
Well...     
One lump or two?     
Two, please.     
Billy?     
Why would I want lumpy tea?     
Isn't he pretty?     
Very pretty.     
I feel pretty.     
I handled it.     
Thank you so much.     
We're family, It's what we do.     
Listen, I'm sorry my wife went down to the bowling alley.     
Please, I'm sorry Brenda made me come to your door.     
I'm not.     
This is the most fun I've had all week.     
I feel bad about the whole thing with the kids.     
Hey, it happens.     
I know, but Bobbi shouldn't be beating on Sheldon like that.     
It's not okay.     
What's not okay.     
is Sheldon getting beat up by a little girl.     
Well...     
Yeah.
