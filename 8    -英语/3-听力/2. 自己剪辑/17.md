Meemaw, are you gonna have more babies?     
Good Lord, no.    
She's too old to have any more babies.    
Don't have to have them,    
You live long enough.    
your hair and your teeth start falling out,    
you start wetting the bed,    
you get to be one.    
That's funny.    
We're gonna have to put a diaper on you.    
You won't be laughing when you're doing it.    
I might be.    
Hey, Meemaw, next to Sheldon, who's smarter, me or Georgie?    
-Me, of course. -Why you?    
My head's bigger.    
It doesn't matter.    
Tonight is not about Sheldon.    
Yeah, right, Everything's always about Sheldon.    
Yeah, Most of time.    
it's like we don't even exist.    
I guess Sheldon does get most of the attention.    
Maybe that's a good thing.    
How?    
Well, if it weren't for him.    
your parents would be on your ass all the time.    
Yeah, I guess I never thought about it that way before.
