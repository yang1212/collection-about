God said, "let there be light".    
and there was light.   
and when God saw that light,   
he knew it was good.   
oh, here we go.   
yes, Sheldon.   
you said he didn't create the sun until day four.   
yeah.   
so how could there be light the first three days?   
god is light.   
so God's photon.   
God's what made photons possible.   
and what day did he do that.   
I would think day one.   
if I grab my chest and kill over,   
maybe we can get out of here.   
that's a terrible thing to say.   
because the first day had just begun.   
so before the Big Bang?   
there was no Big Bang.   
there was only the word.   
was the word kaboom.   
okay do it.   
we gotta go.
