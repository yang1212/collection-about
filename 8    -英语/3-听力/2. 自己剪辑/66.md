-Where's your brother? -Home.     
Is he okay?     
Yeah, he's just...     
Actually, it's not looking good for him.     
He might not make it.     
-Oh, that's terrible. -I know.     
I love him so much.     
If anything ever happened, I don't know what I'd do.     
Shelly, if you don't mind me asking.     
what's your long-term plan here?     
I'm working on the math to turn the garage     
into a self-sustaining ecosystem.     
Okay, And what exactly does that mean?     
All I need is sunlight and a few seeds to grow unlimited food,     
which I'll fertilize with my own feces.     
This just gets better.     
If you're not gonna help, please go inside.     
This is not a show.     
Now that's where I disagree.     
Shelly, baby, please come on out.     
I can't.     
Come on, I'm your mommy.     
Do it for your mommy.     
No.
