Hello, Bobbi.     
You told on me.    
Well, actually, my brother figured it out.    
so, technically, I would argue that I didn't.    
Doesn't matter.    
Uh, I should let you know.    
I've read a book on jiu-jitsu.    
And I'm prepared to throw it at you.    
Shelly, it's just Bactine.    
I didn't even put it on you yet.    
You want to tell me what happened?    
Bobbi Sparks came into the garage...    
And she attacked you?    
Not exactly, I tried to use jiu-jitsu on her,    
but I tripped and fell.    
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry you're having to deal with this.    
It's okay.    
German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche said.    
"That which does not kill us makes us stronger".    
And do you feel stronger?    
No.
