Did you ever have a bully when you were growing up?     
Have you met your grandma?    
I thought you said you handled it next door.    
I did say that.    
Where you going?    
To handle it.    
Should've been you in the first place.    
What?    
Good luck.    
Way to go, Scooby, That's my newshound.    
Missy, I could really use your help.    
With what?    
I'm being bullied by Bobbi Sparks.    
Hilarious, Go on.    
Mom says a man should never raise his hand to a woman.    
But I believe I've found a loophole.    
You're woman, so you're allowed to hit her as much as you want.    
Why would I do that?    
Because I'm willing to pay you.    
How much?    
My life savings, four dollars.    
That's a good start.
