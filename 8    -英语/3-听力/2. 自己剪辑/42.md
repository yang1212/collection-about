So, Sheldon, me and Georgie.     
are gonna take a little road trip this weekend.     
see the shuttle launch.     
Looks like I don't get a vote in this.     
Oh, good, you're catching on.     
I wonder if we'll get to meet an astronaut.     
I remember when I was a teenager,     
I had the biggest crush on John Glenn.     
I would have given it up for him no problem.     
-Mom. -Given what up?     
Her allowance, Just eat.     
So how long are you gonna be gone?     
Oh, we'll have first thing Saturday morning.     
stay the night in a motel,     
and see the launch bright and early on Sunday.     
I can't believe we're going to see     
an actual working spacecraft.     
Look how happy he is.     
Good job.     
How come I don't get to go?     
because you, me and Meemaw are gonna have our own fun     
Could we shoot guns at the gun range?     
Mm, you're too young to go at the gun range.     
Meemaw took me.     
We pinky swore. What are you doing?     
Oh, yeah.     
Don't listen to me.     
I don't know what I'm saying.
