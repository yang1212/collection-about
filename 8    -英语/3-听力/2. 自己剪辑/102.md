What are you doing?         
I'm going to take apart the refrigerator       
and figure out what's making that noise.       
That is a really good idea.       
Usually you're not supportive of my efforts.       
I'm more mature now.       
Hi, mom.       
What did you do?       
Good news. I found out what part was making that noise.       
You have to put this back together.       
Now we're getting to the bad news.       
What made you think you could fix this?       
I'm smart... and I had a book.       
Do you still think you're smart?       
Yes.       
I told him not to do it. He wouldn't listen.       
$200.       
It'll be okay, We'll find the money.
