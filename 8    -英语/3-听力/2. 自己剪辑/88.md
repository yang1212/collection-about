Meemaw?      
Hey, Looking sharp.     
You're not gonna try to sell me a set of knives, are you?     
-No. -It's a joke.     
because of the suit.     
Okay.     
I need money for my Harvard application,     
and was wondering if there are any jobs I could do.     
Hmm, my yard could use a little weeding.     
I'm not terribly fond of outdoor work.     
Plus, that garden gnome terrifies me.     
Ernesto has that effect on people.     
How much does the job pay?     
Well, let me think, How about a dollar an hour?     
-How about five dollars an hour?     
-How about 50 cents an hour?     
Wait a minute. What just happened?     
I'll tell you what, I'll give you a dollar.     
Thank you.     
Okay, here you go.     
I got you a shoveland a bucket and some gloves.     
Did you check the gloves for spiders?     
Is this my first day as Meemaw?
