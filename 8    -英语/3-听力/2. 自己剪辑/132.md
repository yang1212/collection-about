This is pretty basic stuff.            
Yes.          
I'm bored.          
Let's get out of here.          
I can't, I told my dad          
I'd stay here until the end of the lecture.          
Okay, Be a baby.          
I'm leaving.          
In our case, the math yields          
approximately 48,000 years.          
I was most certainly not a baby.          
If anyone was a baby, it was she,          
because people who call other people babies          
are the real babies.          
Wait up.          
I like it it.          
It like you.          
-How much? -Five dollars.          
I only have 50 cents.          
That's okay, We're haggling.          
I don't know what that means.          
You make me an offer, and we meet in the middle.          
The middle of what?          
I'm not really sure.
