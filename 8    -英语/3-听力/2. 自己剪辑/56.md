All right.     
Dig in.    
Excuse me.    
Aren't we going to say grace?    
Uh, we don't do that in our house.    
But you're welcome to do so.    
That's all right, I don't believe in God.    
Well, then why would you say grace?    
Because it makes my mom happy.    
And why are you wearing mittens?    
Well, I don't know where your hands have been.    
Okay.    
Maybe we should just eat.    
Do you like string beans?    
No.    
But I eat them.
