So I saw a lawyer today.    
Why?   
I'm putting together my last will and testament.   
We're gonna miss you.   
George.   
Don't worry, I ain't leaving him squat.   
Are you dying?   
We're all dying, honey.   
From the second we're born.   
it's just a slip and slide into the darkness.   
Unless you get bit by a vampire.   
Well, now that goes without saying.   
I don't want to die. I've only kissed one boy so far.   
What?   
Relax, It was a long time ago.   
Are you relaxed?   
Shelly, you haven't touched your dinner.   
You feel okay?   
Oh, yes, I was just thinking.   
About what, baby?   
The optimal height-to-width ratio for a reusable rocket.   
I was just thinking the exact same thing.   
Really?   
Oh, Moonpie, I love you so much.
