I know. I look great.     
I got you a little going away gift.     
Come on in.     
This necklace has been in our family for generations.     
It belonged to a Comanche warrior     
who gave it to your great-great-great-great grandma.     
Why'd he give it to her?     
Well, according to family lore,     
she was, uh, a very accommodating young lady     
and, uh, they hit it off.     
That's a bird feather.     
-Eagle feather. -Doesn't matter.     
I don't like birds. birds are filthy.     
Okay.     
Fine.     
One featherless family heirloom     
for you to take with you and keep you safe while you're away.     
You don't actually believe this has magic powers, do you?     
Oh, for God's sake, just say "thank you."     
Thank you.     
There's a price tag on it.     
No, there's not.
