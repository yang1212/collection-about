Doctors say the strain, originating in China,     
is particularly severe.    
Children and the elderly are most at risk.    
Sheldon, why are you still up?    
We're all gonna die.    
This isn't funny.    
I know, baby, I know.    
But you need to understand that sometimes    
the news says those things just to scare people.    
Well, it's working.    
Come here.    
I know you don't believe in this.    
but I'm gonna do it anyway.    
Lord, I pray for my son Sheldon.    
that you protect him from all illness and disease,    
and keep him healthy and keep him safe.    
and protect him from his head to his toes,    
inside and out. Amen.    
You're right, I don't believe in that.    
But it did feel good. Thanks.
