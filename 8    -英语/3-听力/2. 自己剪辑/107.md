After a week of tangling with animals.        
Mother Nature, and a delivery man.        
with a good arm and a bad attitude,        
It was time to reap the benefits of my hard work.        
Collecting.        
Collecting.        
-Hey, Sheldon. -Hello, Mrs. Sparks.        
I'm here to collect for this week's paper delivery.        
Right, Hang on.        
Also, I'm given to understand that tipping is customary.        
so feel free to express your appreciation.        
Here you go.        
You tipped me a dime?        
Is there a problem?        
No, it just doesn't seem like very much.        
You were late every day.        
Well, I had to brave the elements.        
I saw you.        
"Brave" isn't the word that I would use.        
Hey, Sheldon.        
You look sad.        
I am.
