About what?       
Mom is so upset about Dad and Meemaw.     
she might want a divorce.     
No one's getting divorced.     
How do you know?     
Great, now I have to throw that out.     
Mother-in-laws are always held in low regard by the father.     
It rarely leads to a breakup of the family.     
He's right.     
Fred and Wilma are still happily married.     
I think if we can figure out,     
a way for Dad to get Meemaw's brisket recipe.     
this all goes away.     
I don't see how we can accomplish that.     
Put that down.     
That's not a toy.     
Sure it is.     
Open wide, Moonpie.     
Here comes the Choo Choo train.     
Mmm. Isn't that good?     
That's Meemaw's famous brisket.     
Would you like the secret recipe?     
You promise not to tell anybody?
