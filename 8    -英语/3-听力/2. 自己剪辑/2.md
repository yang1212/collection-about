How come we ain't got no tater tots?     
I made tater tots last night.    
I'd take tater tots over mashed potaters any day.    
Just eat what I made you.    
Can we at least have tater tots tomorrow?    
It was family dinners like this,    
that let me to adopt a mid-Atlantic accent.    
Nobel Prize winners.    
ought not be ordering tater tots.    
Everybody excited to start school Monday?    
I am.    
I guess so.    
Georgie?    
Freshman year, that's a big deal.    
How can I be excited when he's gonna be in the same grade as me?    
Don't worry, Georgie,     
I'm not planning on being in the ninth grade for very long.    
All I know is he's not in the same grade as me anymore.    
and I'm thrilled.    
Good luck with your finger painting.    
You're gonna get your ass kicked in high school.    
Hey, language.    
I'm not going to be assaulted.    
High school is a haven for higher learning.
