It's interesting the things you thing about,    
when life is ebbing from your body.    
For instance, linoleum, what is it, really?    
Plastic? And if so, how is it different from Formica?    
I'm calling 911.    
And what about Count Chocula?    
How is he a count.    
Did the title come with Land?    
George, Heimlich.    
Don't hurt his little ribs.    
They say, in the final moments.    
your life passes before your eyes.    
All I saw was my brother licking jelly off the knife,    
and putting it back in the jar.    
Okay, it's better now, Sheldon.    
Honey, Are you okay?    
Can you breathe, Say something.    
You have to.. throw away.. that jelly.
