Well, I got to tell you how happy I am.     
that y'all are spending the night with me.     
Your house smells like cigarettes.     
So happy.     
Sheldon, we've talked about this.     
You don't need to announce to people how things smell.     
All right, you two, settle in.     
Are you and Dad gonna get a divorce?     
Of course not.     
Are you sure? Packing up your kids,     
in the middle of the night and moving in with your mom,     
has all the earmarks of a divorce.     
We're not getting a divorce.     
Okay, go to sleep.     
Sweet dreams.     
I can't believe Mom and Dad had a fight over beer.     
I don't think the fight was about beer.     
I think there was more subtext.     
You're probably right.     
Then again, I don't know what subtext is.
