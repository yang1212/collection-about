The little Sparks girl?     
You're kidding, She seems so sweet.    
He says she slaps him around, takes his lunch money.    
She even put a tadpole down his shirt.    
Poor kid, he tucks in those shirts.    
-She looks harmless. -She's cute.    
So she probably gets away with stuff.    
I'm like that.    
I wonder if stray cats poop in that sandbox.    
George.    
You need to talk to her parents.    
Me? Why me?    
Because you're more intimidating than me.    
That's rich.
