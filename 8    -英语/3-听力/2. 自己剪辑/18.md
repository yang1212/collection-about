It wasn't typical for me to wander out into,     
the urban jungle on my own,     
but I was on a mission.     
I had gotten my first taste of serialized superheroes,     
and I needed more.     
Excuse me, do you have X-men #137?     
I'd like to know what happens next, please.     
Back bin in the corner.     
What are you doing here?     
oh, hello, Tam.     
I thought you said comic books are for children.     
I'm a complicated young man.
