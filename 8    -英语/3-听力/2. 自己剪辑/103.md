You know how much it's gonna cost to fix that fridge?       
$200, I have really good hearing.      
Do you have any idea how hard I work for the money we get?      
I'm sorry.      
I don't care how long it takes.      
You're gonna pay me back every cent of this.      
Yes, sir.      
I am very disappointed in you.      
You know if you cry, I can't enjoy your pain.
