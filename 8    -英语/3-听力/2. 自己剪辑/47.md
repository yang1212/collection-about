Sheldon.     
Do me a favor.    
Go help your brother study for his math test tomorrow.    
Is that really a good use of my time?    
Come on, I'm asking nice.        
If he doesn't pass, he won't be able to play football.    
You realize he's often mean to me.    
So? your mother's mean to me. I still try to be helpful.    
Does she break wind on your head?    
Because that's what Georgie does to me.    
Can you help me out here?    
I'll do it if you take me to the train store.    
You got it.    
And buy me whatever I want.    
Connie, what are you doing?    
Just providing my grandson with financial guidance.    
Don't mock the captain.    
If Georgie passes his test.    
I'll get you whatever you want.    
under 20 bucks.    
Deal.
