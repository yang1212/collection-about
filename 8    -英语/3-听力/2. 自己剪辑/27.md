Thus began the longest month of my life.    
Without the ability to access the thrust-to-weight ratios,    
my well-intended effort to humiliate a NASA scientist,    
ground to a halt.    
Mom.    
uh.. what's going on?    
Something's wrong with Sheldon.    
What's the matter, baby? Have a tummy ache?    
I think it's an ulcer.    
Don't be silly.    
-You must have eaten something. -No.    
My symptoms are consistent with an ulcer.    
Shelly, remember when you thought you had leprosy,    
and it was just a patch of dry skin?    
And when you thought you had gout?    
Or an enlarged prostate?    
Or mad cow?    
That was my favorite.    
Well, this is different.    
Maybe we should take him to the doctor.    
Listen to your wife, ulcers are serious.
