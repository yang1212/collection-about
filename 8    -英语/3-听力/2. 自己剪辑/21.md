Are you okay.    
No, I'm not.    
Yeah, so?    
A B plus that's the beginning of the end.    
The end of what.    
My life.    
If I don't make some changes, who knows how far I'll fall.    
I could wind up a drug addict, or a lawyer.    
Is it possible you're overreacting?    
No, starting today, I'm done helping the football team.    
But if you do that, girls will no longer greet me like this.    
I'll greet you like that.    
It's not the same.    
Extricating myself from this situation,    
was not going to be easy.    
My father was counting on me, Meemaw was counting on me,    
the school was counting on me.    
After much thought, I decided to employ    
the one strategic maneuver I knew I could count on.    
I tattled.    
Mom.
