My mother never understand,     
that I actually enjoyed being alone.    
Solitude allowed me to think about important things.    
like the effect of gravitational forces.    
as you approach an event horizon.    
as opposed to less important things.    
like how many grapes my brother can fit in his mouth.    
14.    
Yeah.    
Jean-Paul Sartre said,    
Hell is other people.    
That's humorous because it's true.
