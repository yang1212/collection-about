What...  what is that for?
Well, can't I appreciate my wife?
What did you do now?
I didn't do anything.
Want to hear something cool?
Sheldon skipped out of that lecture
with that little Paige girl, snuck into a closed exhibit.
-You're kidding.  -True.
Even got, "arrested" by the museum security cops.
Why would you think that's cool?
Sheldon got into trouble with a girl.
I'm bursting with pride.
You know what?  I don't want to talk about it.
There, right there.
That's why I love you.
You gonna eat your beans?
Yeah, I'm gonna eat my beans. duh.
What about your tots?
-Those, too, -Georgie.
Just eat your own dinner.
-Dad? -Can't have my tots, either.
