You doing okay?    
I guess.   
I smell ammonia.   
They must've done a thorough cleaning recently.   
I like that.   
And remember, if anybody bothers you,   
what do you say?   
My dad is a football coach.   
And?   
My brother is a football player.   
Good.   
Hey, mom, look.   
The girl's pregnant.   
Congratulations.
