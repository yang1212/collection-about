What are you doing here?          
Uh, just, you know.          
Sheldon wanted to go to a science lecture.          
No kidding.          
We just dropped Paige off there.          
You don't say.          
Caveman stuff, I love that.          
Where are you going? It's closed.          
I can read, baby.          
Just so you know, that won't work every time.          
You haven't, uh, seen Linda around, have you?          
Linda.          
Your wife, Linda.          
Yeah, no.          
So what's new?          
Oh, not much.          
Hey, you like football?          
No.          
Well, you sure? It's a close game.          
Uh, no, no. I'm, uh, more of a tennis man.          
Well, those are two very differents sports, aren't they?          
George...can I confide in you?
