-Hello? -Meemaw.
I'm sorry for waking you,but I know how to kill the cyclops.
We have to play the piccolo.
Ooh, What a great idea, moonpie.
We'll try it tomorrow.
Excellent... Wait.
How'd you answer your phone so fast? It's not next to your bed.
Uh, well, actually, I was on my way to the bathroom.
You know us old people and our bladders.
I'll call you right back.
That fibber.
You're playing the game right now.
I am not.
I saw you with my binoculars.
Oh, How about that.
You promised not to play without me.
We're a team. EMelda Showen, remember?
I'm turning off the game and going to sleep right now.
You'd better.
I love you, good night.
