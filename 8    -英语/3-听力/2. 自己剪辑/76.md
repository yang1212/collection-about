Shelly, you all right?    
Yes.    
I must be a little sore    
from doing jiu-jitsu with Tam yesterday.    
Why were you doing jiu-jitsu?    
We're boys, Roughhousing is what we do.    
-What was that? -What was what?    
That sound.    
What sound?    
What's all this?    
An extra layer of protection.    
Protection from what?    
Sweetie, is someone bothering you?    
-Yes, -Who is it?    
I'd rather not talk about it.    
No, I want a name right now.    
Mary.    
Have you been hurting him?    
Only with my words.    
Tell me who it is, Shelly.    
Mary, slow down.    
Don't tell me to slow down.    
Someone is bulling him.    
Okay. Okay.    
Sheldon, you can't go to school wearing all that.    
Go to your room and take it off.
