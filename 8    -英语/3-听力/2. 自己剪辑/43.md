Missy, where is your brother?     
Who cares?     
Sheldon, you in there?     
Dad.     
Sorry, Georgie.     
What's going on?     
I can't find Sheldon.     
What do you mean, you can't find him?     
I mean I don't know where he is.     
Well, he's got to be somewhere.     
Maybe he got that time machine to work.     
Where the hell...     
George.     
I think he's ready to go.     
Wait, Georgie. Where's your bag?     
Don't need one.     
Got my toothbrush right here.     
What about clothes?     
A change underwear?     
Got it.     
Georgie, you're gonna be gone for two days.     
I'll turn them inside out.
