The average American consumes      
55 pounds of beef per year.      
And then there's Texas.      
where we can knock that off in a couple of months,      
Maybe faster, if we're talking about smoked brisket...      
curiously, the one cut of beef      
that Texans and Jews agree upon.      
This is really good, Meemaw.      
Really good?      
You're spitting the best brisket in Texas,        
all over the damn table.      
Close your mouth when you eat.      
Or aim your face the other way.      
Connie, one of these days, you got to give me the recipe.      
You bet, For sure.      
-One of these days. -Oh, come on.      
You can't hold on to it forever.      
Mean that much to you?      
Mary and I were dating about a month      
when she brought me home for dinner.      
I took one bite of this brisket,      
and I knew I loved your daughter.      
Gee, thanks.      
Kind of like Sleeping Beauty, except Dad kissed meat.
