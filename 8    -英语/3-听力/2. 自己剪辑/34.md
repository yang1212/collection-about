I tell you what.    
You go get a...    
piece of paper and a pencil,    
I'll write it down for you.    
Okay, It's happening...    
That's the fastest I've seen him run.    
It's the only time I've seen him run.    
There you go.    
Okay.    
I might make it this weekend.    
Or you could try a vegetable.    
Vegetable? That's funny.    
Okay.    
Now, this is for your eyes only.    
You're not to share it with anybody.    
I never, I would never.    
You're a horrible person.    
What'd it say?    
I want to know what it said.    
-Me too.  -Just eat.
