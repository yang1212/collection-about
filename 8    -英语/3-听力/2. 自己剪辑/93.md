Fish are kind of boring.           
I know, isn't it great?          
But you can't even pet them.          
Maybe we can.          
Baby, what's wrong?          
I tried to pet Fish, Ah, he was so slimy.          
Well, yeah, he's a fish.          
I put my finger in the top of the tank, then I touched him.          
and he bit me.          
Oh, I'm sure he didn't bite you.          
I can't breathe.          
His fish blood is mixing with my human blood.          
Maybe he was just trying to give you a kiss.          
No.          
He hates me, I never want to see him again.          
Oh, Sheldon, you're being silly.          
Fish like this don't bite.          
Look, See? He's harmless.          
Son of bitch.          
Dad killed my fish.          
George.          
He'll be fine.          
Just got to put him back in the bowl.          
Oh, George.
