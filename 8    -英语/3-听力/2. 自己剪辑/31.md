Thank you very much for taking the time...    
I'm not done.    
Uh...sorry.    
Needless to say.    
we use a P.I.D Controller to minimize the dispersions,    
to the landing site.    
Anything else?    
Yes, I'd like a glass of water,    
It's time to take my Zantac.    
He's been in there quite a while.    
Well, if the topic is science,     
he can be a real chatty Patty.    
This is groundbreaking work.    
Thank you. And...?    
And...?    
I thought you might want to apologize.    
Why?    
You tried to shut me up with a patch.    
Well, I give those to everyone.    
And you have to understand, Sheldon.    
that while your math is-is theoretically correct.    
we don't have the technical capability to execute it.    
So I'm ahead of my time?    
Well... it would appear so.    
All right, call me when you catch up.
