Here.      
All right, now, we just... snap her off.     
like that... pop.     
Grab this guy here.     
and we crack the claw.     
And then you take out a little meat..     
dunk it in some butter.     
and then you eat it.     
Holy moly.     
It's good, huh?     
Unbelievable.     
I'll leave you to it.     
No. Sit with me.     
Okay.     
When I grow up, I'm gonna eat lobster every night.     
Well, you better stay in school and get a good education.     
I was thinking I'd just marry a rich guy.     
Sure, that's a way to go.     
Or a guy who works at Red Lobster.     
That's another way to go.
