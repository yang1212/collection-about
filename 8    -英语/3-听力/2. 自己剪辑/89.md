You better make a whole lot of money       
and take care of me when I'm old.      
I'm not interested in money.      
I'm interested in the pursuit of knowledge.      
That is the wrong thing to say to someone      
who is spending her Friday night as your chauffeur.      
Did you know the word chauffeur is French for "stoker".      
because the first automobiles were steam-powered.      
and the driver had to stoke the engine?      
Right there. Why am I driving you to college      
when you already know everything?      
I didn't know everything,      
but compared to her friends at water aerobics,      
I could see how it felt that way.      
Okay, this is you.      
Good luck.      
Aren't you going to walk me in and get me situated?      
Oh, yes, of course.      
Right this way, my prince.
