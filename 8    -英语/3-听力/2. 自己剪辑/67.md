What are you doing?      
I need to use the bathroom, but it can get uncivilized in there.     
Anyone in there now?     
I don't know, I was afraid to find out.     
Anybody in here?     
Go ahead.     
I'll stand guard.     
Where have you been all my life?     
I don't think so.     
I gotta pee.     
That's your problem. Keep moving.     
-Thank you. -Happy to help.     
Is there any chance you'd be available to stand guard at 1:45?     
You have a bathroom schedule?     
You don't?     
See you later.     
Whoever said the quickest way to a man's heart     
is through his stomach     
did not consider his tiny bladder.
