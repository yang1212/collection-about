It's late, What are you doing up?     
I'm working on the hyperbolic calculations for a rocket return.     
Need any help?     
What?     
I'm kidding.     
Now, turn out the light and go to bed.     
-But... -Now.     
Dad, Can we afford a computer?     
You do my taxes, what do you think?     
Never mind.     
Good night.
