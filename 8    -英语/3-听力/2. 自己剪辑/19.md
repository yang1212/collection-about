If you change your mind, help yourself.    
I didn't have to read many comic books,   
to understand that every superhero had a weakness,   
something they had to overcome   
through an extraordinary act of courage.   
For Cyclops, it was the loss of Jean Grey.   
For Rogue, it was human touch.   
For me, it was food that required chewing.   
So if I truly was a mutant, I would have to do the same.   
On this day, I would not be defeated.   
Because this was the day I became...   
The Chewer.   
Just like that, I overcome my fear of choking.
