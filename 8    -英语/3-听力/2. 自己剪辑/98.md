Can you believe he tried to win me back with a dinette set?       
I'd give you a dinette set if you'd leave Texas.      
So, would you return it?      
Hell no, I'm keeping it.      
But hen you'll be beholden to him.      
Would you ever take Ira back?      
I don't know.      
He's sweet as he can be, but...      
there's just something about John.      
He's like a cute little teddy bear, you know?      
A brilliant.      
bicycle riding.      
teddy bear.      
I don't even understand half of what he says.      
But...      
when he's not around, I just miss him.      
Sounds like you're falling in love.      
Maybe I am.      
Excellent, I love him, too.      
Get out of here.      
If you don't understand what Dr.Sturgis says.      
I'm happy to explain it to you.      
Get.
