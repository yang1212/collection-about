Mom.      
Sheldon can't find his bowtie.      
Really? I laid it out for him.      
Leave it alone, Mary, He doesn't need a bowtie.      
It's his first day of school.      
let him wear what he wants.      
Mom, I can't find my bowtie.      
Dear Lord, why's he got to wear a bowtie?      
Can I drive in with you?      
Sure.      
Everybody's gonna know he's your brother.      
It's gonna be awful for you.      
Tell her to shut up.      
She's not wrong.      
It's got to be here.      
It's not, It's not.      
Shelly, stay calm, We'll find it.      
My tie is gone, my tie is gone.      
Shelly, you don't really need a tie.      
I have to find my tie,      
I have to find my tie.      
Be right back.
