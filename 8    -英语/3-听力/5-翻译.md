Presenting the programme with me today is Li.
今天节目做客嘉宾是李

She hasn't arrived at the studio yet and I must say that I'm a bit nervous about her arrival.
现在她还没有到录音室，不得不说对于她的到来我有些紧张

Something's happened to her recently. she's so unfriendly and even frightening. A real dragon.
最近她经历了些事情。变得不太友好有些吓人。像个恶龙（凶恶的人）。

What are you saying? Why Neil, why are you not waiting for me?
你在说什么呢？NELL你为什么不等我一起

This guy, honestly, right, come on. I haven't got all day. Give me the script.
这家伙，嗯，老实说，好吧。我可没那么多时间，把手稿给我

Ah, hello, I'm Li. blah, blah, blah, this is rubbish as usual.
呃，大家好，我是李，巴拉巴拉巴拉，就像平常一样的糟糕

Li, what's the matter with you?
李，你到底怎么回事？

What do you mean? Can we get on with this please?
你什么意思啊？我们可以继续吗？

Oh, what a dragon！
噢，你这头恶龙（凶恶的人）！

What did you say?
你说什么？

I said that you're a dragon, Li.
我说你就像个可怕的恶龙（凶恶的人））

No I'm not, I'm a rooster.
不不，我属鸡。

No, I'm not talking about your Chinese zodiac sign, I mean your personality.
我没有说你的属相，我是说你的个性。

Oh, oh, thanks.
额 哦 谢谢

What?
啊？

I said thank you.
我说谢谢你！

Li,I called you a dragon that's not a compliment
我说你是龙，可不是在夸你。

Neil called me a dragon. To us Chinese this is a great compliment, but he says it's not. I wonder what he means.
NELL说我是龙。对我们中国人可以说是很荣幸的夸奖了，可他又说不是这个意思，我想知道他是什么意思。

Listen to these examples and see if you can get the meaning.
你听我下面说的这些例子，看你是不是可以明白其中的含义

I'm never going to make my deadline with this report.
我觉得我期限之前做不完报告了

You should speak to Kate to get an extension.
求你帮我去跟Kate要个延期吧

But I'm too scared of Kate. She's such a dragon.
但是我很怕她 她太凶了

That's true. She's so unfriendly and scary. She'll probably shout at you.
是啊，她不太友好又吓人。估计这次又要批你了

Oh, that doesn't sound good. You should go to the Doctor's.
那可不太好，你应该去看个医生

I can't face dealing with that dragon at reception. She's always so rude and aggressive.
我没法和那个恶龙共事了 她粗鲁又咄咄逼人

Yeah, she's the last thing you want to deal with when you're ill.
是的你生病时最不想处理她那些破事了

Ah, now I see that to call someone a dragon in English means something very different to Chinese.
嗯 现在我懂了 英语中用“龙”形容别人和中文中有很大不同

In those examples we have just heard they were using it to describe unfriendly and frightening women.
刚刚我们听到这些例子里 这个词语只是用来形容那些不友好有可怕的女人

Can this be right? Neil, are you calling me unfriendly and scary?
所以是吗，NELL？你是在说我不友好又可怕吗。

Erm. yes. Recently.
是的。现在。

Not strong, courageous and determined? This is what we mean in Chinese when we call someone a dragon.
所以你刚说的“龙”不是我们中国人形容用的 坚强勇敢和坚定吗。

No, I'm afraid not. We use 'dragon' to describe a woman who is unfriendly and frightening.
是的，恐怕不是。我们用龙形容女人不友好以及可怕。

Oh, that's very interesting.
噢，挺有意思。

Yes it is, isn't it?
是啊。呵呵，不是吗。

oh,Hang on, hang on. What do you mean I'm unfriendly? How dare you call me unfriendly.
哦，等下。你说我不友好是什么意思？你怎么敢说我不友好呢。

Well, not usually but recently you have been.
我不是说你一直这样，至少现在是。

You just wait. I will get my revenge on you for this, you little upstart. Who do you think you are?
好，你等等。我要报复你这个狂妄的家伙。你以为你是谁。

Now you're getting scary.
看，现在你多吓人。

I'll show you what a dragon can do. OK, Li I think I'm going to leave now before you start breathing fire.
我就要让你看看龙应该干啥。好吧，李，在你上头（breathing fire：情绪突然激动）之前，我先走一步。

Breathing fire? I'll burn you till you're toast.
吐火？我要把你烤成吐司
