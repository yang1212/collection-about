I thought dad was coming.   
No, he had work to do.   
What kind of work?   
I don’t know, coaching stuff.   
Can’t he do it after the picnic?   
No, missy, he cannot.   
Why not?   
Enough.   
How come Georgie’s not going?   
He’s grounded for eavesdropping on me and your father.   
Well, I hope he learned his lesson.   
Is this about the recipe?   
I bet he’s mad because you always side with meemaw.   
And how would you know that?   
Georgie told me.   
Are you and dad getting a divorce?   
Of course not.   
Well, if you do, I want to live with you.   
Sheldon, no one’s getting a divorce.   
But thank you, honey.
