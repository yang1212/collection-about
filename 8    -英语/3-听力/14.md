There’s my little Moonpie.   
Did you get a chance to look at this week’s game for me?
Not yet.   
You understand there’s a little time crunch involved.   
Meemaw’s  got some outstanding loans I need to pay back.   
I’m sorry, I have to finish my homework,   
And then I have to help my dad.   
Come on.   
I’m  your meemaw.   
I make you cookies.   
How about a little quid pro quo?   
As much as I enjoy your use of Latin, no.   
Shelly, time to get ready for bed.   
But I’m not done.   
Don’t you sass me, too, young man.   
Brush your teeth and get to bed.   
I think your anger might be a little misdirected.   
Don’t you start with me either.   
Now, see, you’re still shooting wide.
