Oh, sugar apple, I love you so much.   
Your affection for inanimate objects frightens me.
I’m glad you’re happy, Missy.   
I’m even happier that I got a toy, And Sheldon got nothing.   
Well, now, we’re not exactly done shopping.   
Sheldon, you still want that computer?    
I thought we couldn’t afford it.      
Don’t you worry about that.   
Do you want it or not?   
More than anything.   
All right, then, let’s go get it.   
Wait, he gets a computer and I get a lousy toy?   
I thought you liked it.   
Not anymore.
