-I’m leaving, -okay, bye.   
Before I go, I need to give this to you.   
You’re interrupting television. What?   
I should be back later tonight, but in case I’m not.   
This envelope contains my whereabouts.   
Do not open it unless you absolutely have to.   
-That it? -yes.   
Okay, bye.   
I knew you were going to open this the moment I left.   
To slow you down I’ve shrouded my destination in code.   
What a dork.
