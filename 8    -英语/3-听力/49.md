Meemaw.    
Want to try that again?    
I need to buy a computer.    
so I can solve the  Navier-Stokes equation.    
uh, How much is a computer?    
Apple has a nice one for $2000.    
but the kind I need costs three million.    
Let me see what I got in the vault.    
Nine bucks and, uh...    
oh, look at that, a peso.    
It's warm.
