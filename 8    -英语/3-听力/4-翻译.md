Hello. I'm Rob. And this is Li.
大家好，我是罗伯，这位是李。

Hello.
大家好

Now, the weather is so great today, we're outside on the sea, sailing in this beautiful boat. So Li, what do you think?
现在，天气晴朗，风和日丽，我们正乘着这艘美丽的帆船航行在海上。李，现在有何感想呢？

Wow, impressive. Rob, I didn't know you had a sailing boat. In fact I didn't know you could sail a boat.
哇哦，这令人印象深刻，罗伯，我一直都不知道你还有帆船。我的意思是：我不知道你能驾驶帆船。

Oh, don't worry Li, I know what I'm doing.
喔，别当心，我知道要怎么操作这艘船。

Oh mind that rock.
噢！小心那个岩石！

Whoa,phew it's okay Li. I'm in control, just keep your hand on that rope.
喔！......嘘......没事儿，李。我控制住船了，你的手可要抓牢那根船绳了。

We've got the wind in our sails, the sea is calm. We can just easily sail around the island and be at home in time for tea.
现在风正吹着我们的船帆，海面很平静。我们可以轻松愉快地绕着这个小岛航行，然后准时回家喝茶。

Oh right. I thought our excursion was going to be trouble free, or plain sailing.
是的，我想我们这次的航行将不会遇到什么麻烦，一帆风顺。

What? Plane sailing? We're not sailing any planes Li.
什么？飞机航行？我们可不是在驾驶什么飞机，李。

No Rob. Plain sailing. It's an expression used to describe an activity that goes well or smoothly and is easy and uncomplicated.
不是的罗伯，“一帆风顺”是一种用于描述事件往好的的方向发展，或者是顺利流畅、简单不复杂的短语。

Yes of course. This sailing is going well and it is actually quite easy. So you're right. This is plain sailing.
那是，这趟航行一切进展顺利，而且相当简单。所以你说的没错，这是一次一帆风顺的航行。

But can we only use the phrase to describe sailing boats?
但我们只能用“一帆风顺”这个词组来表达帆船吗？

No. Although it was originally a sailing term, it can really refer to any activity. Listen to these examples.
当然不是，虽然这个词组的原型是描述航行，却可以用来描述任何与之有关的活动。听听下面这些例子。

Driving through the city was difficult but once we were on the motorway it was plain sailing all the way.
驾车通过城市的道路很困难，但是一旦我们上了高速，那就一路畅通无阻了。

Once we found some office space and recruited staff, setting up our business was plain sailing.
一旦我们找到了办公用地，并且雇佣到员工，那我们就能顺利的开展我们的商业活动了。

So plain sailing means things are going well.
所以“一帆风顺”是“一切进展顺利”的意思。

I have to admit Rob, your sailing skills are very good and, oh watch out for that big wave.
我不得不承认，罗伯，你的驾船技术真实太棒了！喔！小心那个大海浪！！！

Whoa, ouch. Oh oh, I've hit my head on the boom. Oh no, we're heading for the rocks again. Hold the rope Li, quick quick.
噢！！！噢噢噢！我的头撞到了船杆，我们的船要朝岩石驶去了，赶紧抓紧船绳，李，快，快。

I've changed my mind Rob, this isn't plain sailing anymore.
我...我改变我的注意了罗伯，这可不是什么一次”一帆风顺“的航行。

That's taken the wind out of your sails Rob.
这可完全灭了你的风头罗伯。

Err, Li it's still windy. Look at the sails.
额...李，船帆上还有风在吹呢，不信你看看船帆。

No Rob. That's another sailing idiom, to take the wind out of your sails is an expression that means your boasting and arrogance has been challenged.
不，罗伯，这是另一个有关航行的习语——这个表达的意思是你的自夸和傲慢遇到了挑战。

Let's hear some other people using this expression.
我们来看其他人对这个表达的应用：

I was all ready for a big argument but when he bought me some flowers it took the wind out of my sails.
我已经准备好和他大吵一架了，但当他买了一些花给我之后，这挫败了我的锐气。

The negative feedback from my boss has really taken the wind out of my sails.
从老板那里得到的负面反馈给了我当头一棒。

Hmm, so Li you've certainly taught me a lot about sailing today. There are some really good expressions, but one thing you haven't taught me is how to sail this boat.
嗯，李，你今天教了我很有关航海的东西。有许多好的关于航行的谚语，但是你没有教我一件事，那就是如何驾驶这艘船。

But you said you knew how to sail it.
但是你说过你知道怎么驾驶帆船的呀？

Well when I said I had been sailing several times I had, but I meant on a ferry, as a passenger.
嗯，我说我有过几次航行经验，但我的意思是我作为乘客坐在帆船上航行的经验。

Oh, watch out.
喔！小心！

That was close. I've a feeling this really isn't going to be plain sailing after all.
好险啊。我有种感觉，这不会是场一帆风顺的航行。

Too right. Bye bye.
太对了，再见。

Bye. Now Li could you just hold that rope there.
再见。现在，李，请你抓住那边的船绳。
