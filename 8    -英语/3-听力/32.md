Why aren’t you eating?
I don’t think I can.
Sometimes the different foods touch each other, Sheldon.
Not the end of the world.
No, I’m afraid I’ll choke again.
Oh, honey, that’s not gonna happen.
Go ahead, eat your dinner.
What’s all this about choking?
Sheldon almost died this morning.
What? -oh, yeah.
Dad was shaking him upside down like a ketchup bottle.
It was great.
Well, you got to eat something, baby.
Just have a few bites.
I can’t. It’s too risky.
Dibs on the tater tots.
All right, I’ll wrap that up for you.
And if you change your mind, you can have some later.
At least drink your milk.
Sure.
