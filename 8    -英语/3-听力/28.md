This is sheldon cooper, I'm speaking quietly.
because I'm calling from a library.
hello, sheldon, nice to hear from you.
why are you whispering? Are you in a libray?
Good point.
How can I help you?
My meemaw doesn't want to take me to the lecture.
because she thinks that you're just using me to spend time with her.
I see.
well, you're an intelligent young man.
what do you think?
I think she's wrong, 
and you invited me because you know I appreciate the subject matter.
Exactly right.
you're even smarter than I thought.
I knew it.
my meemaw couldn't be more wrong.
oh, like you were reading a book anyway.
