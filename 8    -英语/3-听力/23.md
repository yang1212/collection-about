Hey.
Uh, why are you dressed like a boy?
I made the baseball team.
Oh, so you are a boy.
Get out, I need to change.
-you seem upset, - I am.
I was right? Good for me.
Just get out.
Wait.
You get picked on all the time.
How do you deal with it?
Who’s picking on you?
It doesn’t matter, just tell me.
I usually start by telling myself how much smarter I am.
Than the person who’s picking on me.
But that won’t work for you.
Out.
