Is Daddy gonna be okay?   
Oh, yeah, your pop-pop used to have little chest pains all the time.   
Didn’t he die of a heart attack?   
Well, for insurance purposes, yes.   
Hey, what’s going on?   
Dad’s in the hospital.   
What? Why’s Dad in the hospital?   
He’s gonna be fine.   
He had chest pains.   
He’s gonna be fine.   
What are we doing?   
Why aren’t we going to the hospital?   
Nobody’s going nowhere.   
We’re just gonna stay calm.   
Have a nice dinner, and wait for your mom to call and tell us what’s what.   
I’m not hungry.   
What did you mean by “insurance purposes”?   
Just eat.
