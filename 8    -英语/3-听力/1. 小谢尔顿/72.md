Baby, I think this math problem you're working on is stressing you out.     
It makes sense.     
Einstein struggled with it for 30 years.     
and never found a solution.     
Maybe if you stop thinking about it,     
it'll just come to you.     
No, I can't stop, Sheldon.     
If I stop, I‘ll lose momentum.     
I‘ll never solve it,     
I‘ll be a failure.     
My life will be worthless.     
Okay, that's it,     
You're talking a break from science.     
Give me one good reason why I would do that.     
Where it Dr.Sturgis right now?     
That's a good reason.
