I’ve never been late to school before.   
I’m late all the time. It’s no big deal.   
I get you to school on time every day.   
Why are you late?   
I have a lot of people to say hi to in the morning.    
Mom, would you write a note for me.   
Sure,    
You have the coolest excuse.   
You almost died, Did you see Jesus?   
I saw Count Chocula.   
But feel free to mention my brush with death in the note.   
All right, that’s enough talk about death and dying.   
I came this close to having my own room.
