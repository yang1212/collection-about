Okay, I got your lunches here.    
Extra Fruit Roll-Ups?   
You each got two.   
Thank you.   
Thank you.   
What time is the game?   
12:30.   
Why are we talking about baseball,   
and not my impending docent-hood?   
Who wants to tell him it's stupid?   
Leave it alone.   
And why do they make you wear that goofy costume?   
Ha, They don't. This is all me.   
What do you got going on today?   
ooh, laundry.   
grocery shopping, vacuuming.   
I might go nuts and dust the picture frames.   
Well, nice, Everybody's doing something they love.   
Sheldon, you sure about this?   
Yes, leave the crusts on.   
I'm a docent now.
