Just a heads-up, this is my good side.     
Okay.     
Do you parents know you're wearing that makeup?     
Oh, yeah, my mom knows.     
You sure? Because typically it's not allowed.     
If you don't believe me, you can ask her.     
Okay, we're gonna give her a call.     
Really?     
What were you even thinking?     
I was thinking I look hot.     
You know you're not allowed to wear makeup.     
That's why I didn't tell you.     
And who gave it to you?     
Heather B? Heather M?     
Meemaw.     
So your grandmother was okay with you looking like this      
in your school pictures?     
If you don't believe me, ask her.     
oh, I'm going to.     
Really?
