Boy, this brings back some memories.     
How come?    
Well, when I was your age.    
I was also taken to a university to be studied.    
Because they thought you were really smart?    
Because they thought I was clinically insane.    
And it wasn't just me.    
Did you know that when Albert Einstein was a little boy,    
his parents worried there was something wrong with him?    
Because he couldn't comb his hair?    
No, that was a choice he made later in life.    
when he was young,    
he wanted nothing to do with other children,    
and would often have extreme temper tantrums.    
He sounds like you.    
I know, isn't it great?
