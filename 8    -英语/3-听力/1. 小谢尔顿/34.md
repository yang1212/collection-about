I'm bored.    
Me, too.    
Someday somebody's gonna write a book about Sheldon.    
Don't you want there to be a chapter.    
about how loving and supportive you two were?    
Doesn't matter, I ain't reading it.    
This is groundbreaking work.    
Thank you, And..    
And..    
I thought you might want to apologize.    
Why?    
You tried to shut me up with a patch.    
Well, I give those to everyone.    
and you have to understand, Sheldon.    
that while your math is theoretically correct,    
we don't have the technical capability to execute it.    
So I'm ahead of my time?    
Well, it would appear so.    
All right, call me when you catch up.    
We can go now.
