Why do we need the camera?     
So people in the future can see your transformation.    
Where are you going?    
To put on a dress for the future people.    
Hello, people of the future.    
My name is Missy Cooper and this is my best friend geleste.    
She's dating Joey Lawrence.    
I just don't know where I went wrong.    
Are you sure your questioning was skillful?    
I thought so,     
but after two hours of interrogation.    
all I could extract from my sister's brain     
was that there was some sort of block with new kids on it.    
Sheldon, how's your educational project going?    
Poorly, Iâ€˜ve hit a wall.
