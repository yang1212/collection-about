Why aren't you also driving Missy to school?     
I thought it might be nice for us to chat.    
About Missy?    
She is a bit much, isn't she?    
Here's a question for you.    
Do you ever see or hear things that other people can't?    
oh, all the time.    
Um, do you ever feel paranoid, like people are out to get you?    
I'm a ten-year-old in high school,    
people are out to get me.    
That's fair.    
I just think if I was having these feelings,    
that might be scary, right?    
I suppose so.    
And this is something that's been concerning you?    
Maybe.    
Lately.    
A little, But the important thing is that we can always,    
talk about this kind of thing each other.
