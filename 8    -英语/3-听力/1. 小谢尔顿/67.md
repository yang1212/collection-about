Sheldon, get up.     
What's the point?     
We're going to Houston.     
Really?     
Yeah.     
You and me are gonna give those space monkeys a little talking to.     
I often found my father to be a strange and puzzling man.     
but at that moment,     
I never loved him more.     
I don't see why I couldn't stay home.     
because we're having a fun family outing.     
Can I at least drive?     
She said fun, not tragic.     
Let's go to the ostrich farm.     
Cool.     
We can ride them, and then we can eat them.     
We're not stopping anywhere.     
We're going to Houston to straighten this thing out for your brother.     
then we're going home.     
Shelly, you doing okay?     
Yes, I just hope I don't get carsick.     
You want Daddy to pull over?     
I'll be okay.     
Oh, god, it's on my shoes, it's on my shoes.     
For pete's sake, somebody open a window.
