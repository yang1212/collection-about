Missy, don't forget that you have to pick out a present     
for that birthday next week.     
Momm it's "Melissa" now.     
Middle school.     
-Who's Melissa? -Me.     
Then who's Missy?     
"Missy" is short for "Melissa".     
Like how "Billy" is short for "William".     
I don't understand.     
You know how your real name is William?     
I'm Billy.     
No, we call you Billy, but your real name is William.     
But my underpants say "Billy" in them.     
Mom, is my name William?     
Yeah.     
Then whose underpants am I wearing?
