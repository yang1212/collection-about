What are you looking for?     
Chest hairs.     
Is there any chance I'll hit puberty in the next few weeks?     
oh, God, I hope not.nWhy?     
The campus is so big.     
I'll never make it from one class to another,     
without a solid dose of testosterone.     
Maybe they'll let you leave early so you'll have time.     
But the end of the class is when      
I point out the teacher's mistakes.     
Everybody loves that.     
I'd say run across campus.     
but I know how you feel about sweating.     
It's the urine of the skin.     
Why not ride your bike?     
I considered that, but I can't let my colleagues see me with training wheels.     
They'll think I'm a child.     
Can't have that.     
See any fuzz growing?     
Let me look.     
No, Meemaw, Bad Meemaw.
