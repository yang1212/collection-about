Excuse me.    
Seriously, dude, you need to relax.    
How can I relax?    
I'm being held captive in a bacterial playground.    
Why are you here?    
I had to have my gallbladder removed.    
Why are you here?    
I'm having surgery tomorrow.    
How come?    
I was born with a hole in my heart.    
My mom says everyone is born with a Jesus-shaped hole in their heart.    
but I'm guessing this is different.    
Yeah, they're gonna put a patch on it.    
And then it just stays there forever?    
Yeah, like a Band-Aid you never have to pull off.        
That's great, because that's the worst thing about Band-Aids.
