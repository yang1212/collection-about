This is oddly reminiscent of a dinner with my family.    
You're funny.   
I know.   
My family never eats dinner together.   
Why not?   
My dad always manages to come home from work after we're done.   
Hmm, My dad never misses a meal.   
Do you think Stone Age parents stayed together forever?   
They had to.   
There were no lawyers.   
What?   
That was funny.   
Right, we've established I'm funny.   
Well, I think my parents are getting a divorce.   
Why?   
They fight all the time.   
About what?   
Mostly me.   
Hmm, That's too bad.   
I guess I'm lucky.   
Why?   
I'm the glue that holds our family together.   
What are you kids doing in there?
