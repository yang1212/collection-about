So how was school today?     
Sheldon's got a girlfriend.     
Whatï¼Ÿ     
That's no true.     
Oh,yes, it is.     
I seen him talking to her at school.     
Sheldon Lee Cooper, you dog.     
Is she cute?     
Compared to what?     
What grade is she in?     
Eleventh.     
An older woman.     
Nice.     
Most everybody's older than me.     
Why is that nice?     
So what do you think, George?     
Is it time to have "The talk" with him?     
What talk?     
No talk, Nobody's talking.     
If "the talk" is in regards to human reproduction,     
I already understand how that works.     
How do you know that?     
I told him.     
oh, Lord.
