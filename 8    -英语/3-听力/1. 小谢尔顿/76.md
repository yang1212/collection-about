What is your problem?     
oh, I don't have a problem.     
You should probably wash your hands.     
I just witnessed an altercation between you and Georgie Cooper.     
Altercation?     
A confrontation, a tussle, Anyway.     
I'd just like to gather more information for sociological purposes.     
Oh, I heard about you,     
you're that smart kid.     
I'd like to be humble in this moment,     
but yes, that's me.     
Sheldon Cooper, at your service.     
So Georgie's your brother?     
Correct.     
And you're trying to protect him?     
Incorrect.     
I'm just curious what he did to incur your wrath.     
Also, kudos on the hand washing.
