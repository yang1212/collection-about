Um, okay, Bazinga.    
That was pathetic.    
It was.    
I‘m not sure I‘m cut out for these antics and shenanigans.    
I guess you're gonna grow up to be a weirdo.    
I suppose I am.    
Life is so confusing.    
I always hoped it would be easier for me.    
when I grew up, but...    
now I'm not so sure it will.    
It's gonna be all right.    
You were faking?    
Bazinga.
