Sheldon, What do you want on your pizza.      
Still glad you came?     
Actually, I am.     
I don't want any pizza.     
See? Pain in the ass.     
Well, we can get something else.     
I don't want anything, I'm not hungry.     
Well, what's the matter?     
My friends were supposed to play     
Dungeons & Dragons with me.     
but they cancelled.     
Aw. Sorry.     
We can play it with you.     
Really?     
Dale, that's nice. but...     
I don't think you'll like it.     
Afraid I might beat you?     
Actually, there's no one winner, It's a cooperative game,     
where you use your imagination to explore a fantasy world,     
with the help of the Dungeon Master's preplanned scenarios     
and the rolling of polyhedral dice.     
Still sound fun?     
Yeah.
