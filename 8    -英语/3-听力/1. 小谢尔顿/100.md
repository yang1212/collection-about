Hi, Sheldon.
Paige, What are you doing here?
My mom made me.
See? She doesn't want to be here either.
I'm gonna go say hi to your mom.
Why did your mom make you?
Punishment.
I got caught with cigarettes.
Why would you want to smoke?
To look older.
My meemaw smokes, I guess it works.
So, why are you here?
Do you believe in this stuff now?
No, Stamp camp got canceled.
Further proof there is no God.
