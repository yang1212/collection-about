Good news, I just spoke to Tommy Clarkson.     
What? Are you crazy?      
Nope, Mom had me tested.     
And Tommy's actually nicer that you think.     
I told you to stay out of it.     
True, but what you didn't tell me,     
was that you were overly chummy with his girlfriend.     
Which is why he wants to kick your bottom.     
I'm about to kick your bottom.     
I don't think so.     
Hey, Tommy.     
How you doing?     
You got a problem with him,     
you got a problem with me.     
And just to make his logic clear.     
you do have a problem with me.     
Don't listen to my brother,     
I don't have a problem with anybody.     
You need to apologize.     
I'm very sorry.     
To him.     
I'm very sorry, Sheldon.     
Later, kid.     
See? He's nice.
