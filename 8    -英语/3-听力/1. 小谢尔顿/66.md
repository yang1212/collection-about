You kids excited to go back to school?     
of course I am.    
He doesn't speak for me.    
What are you doing?    
Having coffee.    
Uh, no, not in my house.    
oh, come on,     
the best part of waking up is Folgers in your cup.    
Put it down.    
I can't drink coffee,    
I can't chew tobacco,    
is there anything I can do.    
Yeah, quit talking.    
Where's Dad?    
He went to Oklahoma for that job interview.    
I thought you put your foot down on that one.        
Just keep eating your breakfast.    
You really think we might move there?    
I don't know what to think.
