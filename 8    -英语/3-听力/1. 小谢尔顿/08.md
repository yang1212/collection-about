Dad, how would you like to be rich?  
Go away.  
Aren’t you even a little curious?  
Does it involve me giving you money?  
Yeah, but then I give you more money back.  
How much more?  
Way more.  
You got to get in on this.  
Thanks, I’m not interested.  
You’re gonna regret it.  
Show me.  
Texas snow gloves.  
The card store on Magnolia is going out of business.  
They’re selling these for one dollar each.  
I sell them for five, and the money rolls in.  
Does it worry you that the store selling these things is going out of business?  
You have no vision.  
Can I get back to the game?  
Fine, I don’t need your money.  
I have my own.  
Then why are we having this conversation?  
because I’d rather lose your money than mine.  
See? Vision.
