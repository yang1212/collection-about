he's not using me to spend time with you.    
He said so, You're wrong.   
You had no business calling him, Sheldon.   
You seem upset.   
Are you embarrassed because you were wrong?   
No,   
Are you sure? I would be.   
I'm not wrong.   
He's lying to you, Sheldon.   
Interesting.   
I don't know who to believe.   
Really?   
You're gonna believe some guy you barely knowï¼Œ   
over your own grandmother?   
Well, one of them said I'm really smart,   
and one of them's yelling at me right now.   
We're done talking about this.   
And I'm not taking you to that lecture.   
But I really want to go.   
Too bad.   
You are incredibly selfish.   
Excuse me?   
You just care about what you want.   
You don't care about what I want, You're selfish.
