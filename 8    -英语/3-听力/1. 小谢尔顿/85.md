She may love football and she may love God.     
but she was born in Scarsdale.     
That's in New York.     
There's more.     
My opponent didn't move to Texas until she was seven years old.     
In fact, in her bedroom there's a pennant for the New York Yankees.     
While I may not be a fan of organized religion or sports.     
I promise, if you vote for me,      
I'll do my best to get new science equipment for our school.     
Don't mess with Texas.
