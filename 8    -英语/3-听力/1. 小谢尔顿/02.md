Missy, I could really use your help.    
With what?    
I'm being bullied by Bobbi Sparks.    
Hilarious, Go on.    
Mom says a man should never raise his hand to a woman.    
But I believe I've found a loophole.    
You're a woman,     
so you're allowed to hit her as much as you want.    
Why would I do that?    
Because Iâ€˜m willing to pay you.    
How much?    
My life savings, four dollars.    
That's a good start.    
Now, let's talk TV privileges.    
What do you want?    
Complete control every afternoon for two months.    
That's when professor proton is on.    
I know, sucks for you.
