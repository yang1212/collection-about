Hello, Cooper residence.   
Sheldon speaking.  
Hey, Shelly.  
oh, hello, Mom.  
How's your day going?  
Shelly?  
Shelly? Shelly? You there?  
Yes, I'm here.  
She wants to know how my day's going.  
Say it's going good.  
I can't say that.  
Why not?  
It's bad grammer.  
How are you supposed to say it?  
It's going well.  
oh, that's nice.  
I've got to get back to work.  
but I love you and miss you very much.  
Okay.  
I handled that really well.
