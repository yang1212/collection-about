Hello, Randall, I would like to apply for a job.
-you would? -yes.
I need to earn money so I can apply to Harvard.
I thought about going to Harvard.
But then I realized the shack is my passion.
So can I work here?
Excuse me, How much RAM does this computer have?
Um, I can check on that for you.
It comes with 640 kilobytes, but it’s expandable up to 768.
Well?
Do you even have a resume?
No, but I have a report card that’ll knock your socks off.
