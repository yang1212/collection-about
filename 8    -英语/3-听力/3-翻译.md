Hello, and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Jennifer, and with me in the studio is, yawn, Helen.
## 大家好，欢迎来到《英语我在说》频道。我是詹妮弗，今天与我一起主持节目的是……海伦


Hi Jen. Are you a bit tired? Oh yes, I really am. I've been here since seven this morning. I think I'm ready to call it a day now.
## 珍，你有点累了吗？哦，的确是。我从早上七点就待在这里了。我想我可以准备收工了


What do you want to call it? Monday? Tuesday? Oh no, I don't mean. How about Saturday? That's my favorite day.
## 你把它称为什么？周一？周二？不，不是那个意思。周六如何？那是我最喜欢的一天


Or we could call it a new day altogether. What about cake-day, or coffee-day. I don't want to rename the day.
## 或者我们称它为全新的一天。蛋糕日或者咖啡日怎么样？我不想再去重新命名这一天


In English, if you're ready to call it a day, it means that you want to finish whatever you're doing, and usually go home.
## 英语里，如果你准备call it a day，意思是你想要完成当前正在做的事情，通常是回家


So you want to call it a day now? We haven't finished the programme yet. That's true.
## 所以，你想要收工了吗？我们的节目还没结束呢。这倒是啊


In that case, let's hear some examples of the phrase in action. We're getting nowhere with this.
## 这种情况下，我们来听一些这个短语的例句。我们对此毫无进展。


Shall we call it a day and start again tomorrow? I'm getting picked up from work at five, so I think I'd better call it a day.
## 我们今天就到这儿吧，明天再开始好吗?我5点下班，所以我想今天就到此为止吧。


I see, so if you call it a day, you decide that it's time to finish the work you're doing. That's right, so let's call it a day right now.
## 我明白了，所以如果你call it a day，意思就是你决定是时候完成你正在做的工作了。对，所以我们今天就到此为止吧。


Alright then, do you fancy a quick drink after work? Well, I'm feeling pretty tired, but I suppose I could come out for one drink.
## 好吧，下班后想不想去喝一杯?嗯，我感觉很累，但我想我可以出来喝一杯。


Let's go then! Some time later... Jen, look at the time, we've been here seven hours. I know. I don't know where the evening went.
## 那走吧！一段时间后…珍，看看都几点了，我们都待了七个小时了。我知道。都不知道晚上去哪了。


It's probably time to call it a night. I thought the phrase was "call it a day"? We can also say "call it a night" if you've been somewhere in the evening and you know it's time to go home.
## 今晚就到此为止吧。我以为那句话是"收工"我们也可以说“call it a night”，如果你晚上去了某个地方，而且你知道该回家了。


Well, I definitely think that you need to call it a night, then. Although look. What? The sun is coming up already.
## 我觉得你今晚就到此为止吧。尽管看。什么?太阳已经出来了。



We've been out on the town all night. Perhaps we should call it a day instead? That means it's nearly time for work again. Can I call in sick, please?
## 我们在城里玩了一晚上。也许我们今天就到此为止吧?那意味着又到上班的时间了。我可以打电话请病假吗?
