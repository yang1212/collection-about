Hello, 
I'm Neil. 
And I'm Helen. 
How are you Neil? 
Not good. 
What's wrong? I posted my house-keys. 
You posted your house-keys?
## 1、你好，我是Neil。我是Helen。Neil你最近怎么样？不太好。怎么了？我寄出了我家的钥匙。你把你家钥匙寄出去了？


Let me guess, 
you dropped them in the letterbox by mistake. 
Yes, I got mixed up. 
Instead of putting a letter in, 
I put my keys in.
## 2、我猜是你错把它们扔进邮箱了吧。是的，我弄混了，我没有把信放进邮箱反而把钥匙扔进去了。


Oh dear. But I have my address attached to my keys, 
so maybe they'll end up getting posted back to me. 
Yes, you might get them posted back to your house or you might get burgled, 
now that someone has your address as well as your house-keys.
## 3、天哪，亲爱的。但是我的钥匙上附有我的地址，所以他们最终应该会把它寄还给我。是的，你可能会收到他们寄回来的钥匙，或是你可能遭到盗窃，因为现在某个人有你家的地址以及你家的钥匙。


Oh no, thieves might get into my house. 
I'd better go and wait outside to see what happens. 
OK, good luck. 
I'll keep you posted. 
See you later. 
Neil will "keep me posted".
## 4、不要啊，小偷可能会来我家的。我最好去外面等着看看会发生什么。好的，祝你好运。我会和你保持联系的。再见。Neil会“和我保持联系”。


That doesn't mean he's going to put me in the postbox, 
even though he's obviously a bit confused about what should or shouldn't go in postboxes.
## 5、这不是说他要把我放进邮箱里，即使他对于什么该放进邮箱里什么不该放进去明显地有点混乱。



It means he will keep me informed, 
he will tell me what happens. 
Listen to some examples.
I don't know what time they're arriving, 
but I'll keep you posted.
## 6、这意味着他会持续告知我，他会告诉我发生了什么。仔细听下面的例子。我不知道他们什么时候会到，但是我会和你保持联系。


Keep me posted on how things go in your new job. 
I kept them posted on what was happening.
I hope Neil's keys find their way home.
Hello? Hi, it's Neil. 
Neil. Any news?
## 7、对于你新工作的发展和我保持联系。我会告知你发生的事情。我希望Neil的钥匙会回来。喂？你好，我是Neil。Neil，有什么消息吗？


Well, someone posted my keys back to me. 
Great. But they put them through the letterbox. 
Oh no, so you've got your keys back, 
but now you're locked out.
## 8、嗯，有人把我的钥匙寄回来了。真棒。但是他们把他放进了邮箱。天哪，所以你的钥匙回来了，但是现在你被锁在门外了。


And I'm stuck. 
I tried to get through a window but I don't fit. 
I'm half-in, half-out. 
Thank goodness, help must be arriving. 
Don't move.
Does it look like I can move? 
Hands on your head.
## 9、而且现在我被卡住了。我试着通过窗户进去但是我的身材不适合。我现在一半在里边，一半在外面。感恩上帝，我一定会得到帮助的。不要动。我现在看起来像是可以动的吗？把你的手放到头顶。


Oh dear, it sounds like someone called the police. 
They probably thought Neil was a burglar.
But, this is my house. 
Is it indeed? 
I'd better leave you to explain yourself now.
## 10、亲爱的，这听起来像是有人叫了警察。他们可能认为Neil是一个小偷。但是这是我家。这是真的吗？我最好留下你让你为自己解释一下。


But do keep me posted Neil. 
Keep you posted. 
How am I going to do that if I'm locked up? 
Arrested for breaking into my own house. Bye.
## 11、但是一定要和我保持联系，Neil。和你保持联系，但如果我被关起来我能做什么呢?因为闯进自己的家被逮捕。再见。
