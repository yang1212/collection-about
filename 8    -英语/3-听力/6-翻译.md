Hello, and welcome to The English We Speak. My name is Helen.
大家好，欢迎收听英文频道«我们说英语»。我是 Helen。

And I'm Steve. How are you, Helen?
我是Steve。最近过得如何，Helen?

Actually, I'm feeling very positive, thanks Steve.
现在，我过的非常棒，谢谢。

Why? What's happened?
为啥？发生什么好事了？

Well, I found out on Friday that I'm getting a promotion at BBC Learning English, then on Saturday I won ￡1,000 on the lottery.
嗯，我发现上星期五，我在BBC中英语得到了提升，后来在星期六我赢得了￡1000的彩票。

Wow, that's brilliant.
哇，太棒了。

Yes, and then on Sunday it got even better. I found out that some paintings I've done are going to be displayed at an art gallery in London.
是的，然后在星期日变得更棒了。我发现我画的一些画将在伦敦的一个美术馆展出。

That's amazing, Helen, you're on a roll at the moment, aren't you.
太棒了，海伦，你现在运气真好!

Er, I'm on a what?
呃，什么？

On a roll.
运气真好。

Roll? I don't roll. I walk, or sometimes I run if I want some exercise. A football rolls if I kick it across the ground.
打滚？我并不打滚，我走路，有时我想要运动时，我会跑步。只有踢球的时候， 我脚下的足球才会滚来滚去吧。

Sure, a football rolls, but you can be on a roll. It means you're experiencing lots of success or good luck at the moment.
没错，只有足球会滚来滚去，但也可以说成运气好。它的意思是你正在经历着许许多多的成功或好运。

I see, the phrase 'on a roll' means you are having lots of good luck in your life. Let's listen to an example.
我懂了，‘on a roll’的是好事接踵而来，一帆风顺的意思。我们来听一个案例。

I hear your sister's getting married.
我听说你妹妹要结婚了。

Yeah, she met this amazing guy while she was working in the theatre in London, and six months later they're engaged.
是啊，她在伦敦剧院上班时遇到了一个不错的人，过了六个月他们订婚了。

And then, yesterday she was offered the lead part in the theatre's new play. She's really on a roll.
然后，她昨天担任了新剧中的主角。她运气可真好。

So that woman is excited because her sister is on a roll, she met an amazing guy who she's now engaged to, and then she was offered the lead part in a play.
这位女士为她的妹妹高兴，因为她的妹妹最近的运气特别好， 首先她找到了她的白马王子，还订了婚，接下来她被选中当舞台剧的女主角。

Yes, if you're on a roll it means lots of things are going well for you at the moment. Here’s another example.
是的，你可以把很多事情做好，如果你运气很棒的话。这是另一个例子。

How are Arsenal doing in the Premier League these days?
这些天阿森纳队在英超比分怎样？

Oh, they're totally on a roll. They've won all three games this month, including the one against Man United.
哦，他们现在一帆风顺。他们本月赢得了所有三场比赛，包括一场与曼联的比赛。

So that man thinks his favourite football team are on a roll because they've won all their games?
这支球队这个月没输过一场球，运气可真好。

Yes, they've won every game they've played this month, they're playing really well.
是啊，他们打赢了本月的每一场比赛，他们表现的非常好。

Oh, oh. Wait a second. I've got a text message from my husband.
哦，哦。稍等一会儿。我看一下我丈夫的短信。

What's he saying, have you won the lottery again? Are you still on a roll?
他说了什么，你又赢了彩票吗？你依然运气特别好？


No, actually, he's just had his bike stolen, and earlier he lost his car keys.
不会吧，他的自行车被偷了？怎么车钥匙也丢了呢!

Oh, dear, that's bad luck! Unlike you, he's definitely not on a roll.
哦，天哪，那真倒霉！不像你，他运气也太不好了。

No, I'd better go and help him look for those keys. Bye.
唉，我最好去帮他找那些钥匙。拜拜。

Bye.
拜拜。
