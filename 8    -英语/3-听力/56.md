How come you're not eating your snack?    
I prefer my snack to be a reward for homework well done.    
You're like an old person.    
Thank you.    
What's your homework?    
Non-Euclidean geometry.    
How about you?    
"Symonyms".    
You mean synonyms.    
I'm pretty sure she said "Symonyms".    
Did you see that?    
Someone's out there.    
oh, no, They're in the backyard.    
What do we do?
