Mom, will Dr. Sturgis be coming over again?
I don’t know, he should.
We had so much fun talking about the mental hospital.
We barely got to talk about science.
Well, I don’t know what his plans are.
Is Meemaw coming for dinner tonight?
No, she is busy.
With Dr. Sturgis?
Maybe I can join them.
All my fun facts make me a welcome addition to any dinner date.
She’s not gonna be with Dr.Sturgis, sweetie.
Then I don’t understand why I can’t invite him over.
Your Meemaw and Dr.Sturgis are…
Figuring out how their relationship is gonna work,
Now that he’s back.
Why does their relationship need to be any different?
It’s complicated.
So, we can’t have him over?
Sorry, it’s just not a good idea right now.
This isn’t fair.
I find the one person in Texas who understands me.
And now I’m not allowed to see him?
