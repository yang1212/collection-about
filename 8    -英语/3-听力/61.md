Hello.    
Hello.    
My name is Sheldon.    
Yeah, you're Sheldon Cooper.    
You know who I am?    
Well, there's only one nine-year-old in high school,    
and you still have your baby teeth.    
She knows who I am.    
It's going well.    
What do you want?    
Would you like to have lunch with me and my friend?    
Why?    
Why else?    
So we can have a spirited conversation about geostatistics.    
You really are as smart as everybody says.    
My teeth are small,    
but my prefrontal cortex is enormous.
