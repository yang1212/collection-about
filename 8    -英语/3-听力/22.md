Hey, I’ve been looking all over for you.   
Do you know how popular we are?   
-we? -yeah.   
I put the word I was helping you with the football stats.   
And since I’m Asian, they bought it.   
Well, I’m glad you’re enjoying it.   
You’re not?   
I was touched 82 times this afternoon.   
What do you mean, “touched”?   
Not inappropriately.   
Joyfully.   
Affectionately.   
A cheerleader hugged me to her bosom.   
That’s amazing.   
No more high fives.   
I can’t keep washing my hands.
