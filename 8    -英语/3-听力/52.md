Wait, Georgie, Where's your bag?     
Don't need one.     
Got my toothbrush right here.     
What about clothes?     
A change of underwear?     
Got it.     
Georgie, you're gonna be gone for two days.     
I'll turn them inside out.     
-Shotgun, -NO, NO.     
Let your brother sit up front for a change.     
I actually prefer sitting in the back.     
It's safer.     
oh, come on, sit up front with your daddy.     
He doesn't get to spend enough time with you.     
I called shotgun.     
George.     
We'll flip a coin.     
All rightï¼Ÿ Georgie, call it.     
Heads.     
Tails.     
Dang it, Sheldon, you won.     
You get to ride up front.     
Can't we do two out of three?     
You won, Get in the car.
