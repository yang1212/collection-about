So, it's an emergency.    
Call Meemaw.

We can take care of this.    
No, we can't.    
Sheldon, if we can't handle a little splinter.    
they're never gonna leave us alone again.    
You're right.    
So, what do we do?    
Let me see it.    
oh, boy, That's a deep one.    
Hey, it's throbbing really bad.
