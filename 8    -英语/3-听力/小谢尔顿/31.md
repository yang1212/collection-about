Mom.   
Meemaw swatted me on the bottom.   
What? Why?   
I wanted something, and then she said no.   
And then I called her selfish, and then she went crazy.   
Let me call her.   
Really? You don’t want to thank her in person?   
You were very rude to your grandmother.   
Dad’s rude to her all the time.   
That is not.. the point.   
Do you have anything to say for yourself？   
Yes, I really wanted to go to this lecture.   
And I understand that I upset Meemaw very much.   
So which one of you will be taking me?   
No one’s taking you.   
You’re not going, Sheldon.   
You two are even selfish than Meemaw.   
How long you grounded for?   
A month.   
That sounds right.
