Meemaw is coming over to watch you, I gotta go.   
Where?    
Daddy’s not feeling good.   
We’re gonna go see a doctor.   
Is he okay?   
He’s gonna be fine.   
You just sit right there.   
Meemaw’s on her way over to cook you dinner.   
Can we come with you?   
No, just stay right there, don’t move.   
George, let’s go.
