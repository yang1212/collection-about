You want to explain yourself?   
I'd rather just go to bed,   
since I have to be up in a few hours anyway.   
Look, I understand you're tired,   
but that is no reason for you.   
I'm not just tired, I'm exhausted.   
Everything hurts.   
I get up in the morning to do this job I don't even like,   
and I'm doing it just for the money,   
and it's not even a lot of money.   
I keep trying harder and harder,   
and it doesn't even make a difference.   
So if you're going to yell at me or punish me,   
let's just get it over with.
