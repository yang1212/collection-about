So, how was everybody’s day?
I’m done with high school.
What does that mean?
Well, I don’t learn anything there.
And I don’t want to go anymore.
Well, where do you think you’re gonna go?
Who cares? Let him go.
Shh, well?
I’ve been corresponding with Dr.John Sturgis,
At East Texas Tech.   
He said I could audit his course.   
Your pen pals with a stranger? Is this okay?   
He’s not a stranger, he’s a famous scientist.   
He carbon-dated the oldest human feces.   
That ain’t strange.   
Now, Shelly, I appreciate that you want to expand your horizons.   
But how would you even get there?   
The school’s an hour away.   
I’m working, your dad’s working.   
Again, who cares? Let him go.   
He could hitchhike.   
Perfect.   
It’s only one day a week.   
And I was hoping Meemaw could take me.
