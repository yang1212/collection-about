Sheldon, I'm talking to you.    
Well, I'm not talking to you.   
Okay, what's going on?   
After having my first good night's sleep in a week,   
I woke up with a fresh perspective.   
And that is..?   
It was irresponsible of you to burden me with that secret.   
Sheldon, we've been through this.   
It's complicated.   
While I may not look up to you from an intellectual standpoint.   
I've always looked up to you as a role model.   
I can't do that anymore.   
And don't worry.   
we made a deal.   
I'll continue to keep your secret.
