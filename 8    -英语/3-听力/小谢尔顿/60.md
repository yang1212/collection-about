You awake?     
Yes.     
Are you gonna miss me?     
I haven't given it any thought.     
Well, we're just lying here.     
Think about it.     
I am used to you.     
I'm used to you, too.     
It's not the same as liking you.     
No.     
To me, you're like string beans.     
No one asks for them,     
no one wonders about them.     
They're just there on the plate.     
But you eat them, right?     
Yes.     
You're gonna miss me.          
All right, let's say grace.      
Guess I get to hold hands with you now.     
Guess so.     
Maybe Sheldon's mittens weren't such a bad idea.
