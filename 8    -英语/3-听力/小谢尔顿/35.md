Dad, banking question.   
What’s that, buddy?   
I noticed there’s a check missing.   
I have a copy of check 128,    
and a cope of check 130, but 129 isn’t there.   
Oh, yeah, don’t worry about it.   
But I enjoy worrying,   
I find it very relaxing.   
Of course you do.   
I balanced the rest of the account.   
And it appears to be a check for $300.   
All right, well, let’s just put it down for $300 for miscellaneous.   
I’ve never labeled anything miscellaneous in my life.   
I’ll go ask mom.   
Wait.
