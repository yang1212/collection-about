hello.   
hi.   
who are you.   
I'm Paige.   
I like your bow tie.   
Thank you.   
you seem awfully young, Paige.   
are you with an adult who's taking this class?   
no, Dr.Sturgis heard about my research,   
on quantum chromodynamics at high temperatures.   
and invited me to audit his course.   
is that so?   
yes, he's been super nice.   
interesting, well, just so we're clear.  
he's my mentor, he's my meemaw's boyfriend.  
and he had spaghetti and hot dogs at my house.  
the spaghetti goes on the hot dogs?  
no,  
you realize this is a very advanced class.
