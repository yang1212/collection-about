Is there anything else?   
There is, but.., I’m not allowed to ask about it.   
Oh, it’s okay, you can ask me anything.   
Oh, good, I don’t like cats.   
But I share their curious nature.   
What do you want to know?   
Your mom has a boyfriend.   
Yeah.   
Where is your father?   
I don’t know.   
Why do you not know?   
Well, he left when I was really young,    
and I never heard from him again.   
And why are you staying here?   
My mom’s boyfriend isn’t very nice.   
I understand, my sister isn’t very nice.   
So you get it?   
I do, thank you.   
Okay, well, talk to you later.   
But not between 7:00 and 7:12.   
Yup, I see it right here.
