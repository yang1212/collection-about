Dad, could you please come into the living room?
What for?
My brain did something impressive.
And I’d like to share it with you.
What are you doing here?
Same as you.
I want to see what his brain did.
Please have a seat.
All right, well.
I know Meemaw’s brisket recipe.
What?
No, you don’t.
Yes, I do.
And in order to bring peace to this family.
i’m prepared to make it public.
You’re bluffing.
