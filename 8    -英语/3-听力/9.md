Oh, hi, Mary.   
Linda, So good to see you.   
-Hi, Sheldon,  -Hello,    Paige.   
-Hi, Missy, -Hi    
Look at these rain boots.   
They have ducks on them.   
And the ducks are wearing boots.   
Those are so cute.   
-well, what a nice coincidence.   
-yeah, Good to see you.   
Yeah, How are things?   
Well, at the moment, trying to get shoes for Sheldon.   
But they only have these, not the ones he likes.   
Ah, you know, I think that brand is the same kind Einstein wore.   
Well, I’ve never seen a picture of his feet.   
And you’re a grown-up,   
So you wouldn’t lie to me.   
I guess I have no choice but to believe you.   
All right, I’ll try them. Great.   
Hey, Mom, can Missy and I go to the Hello Kitty store?   
Well, it’s okay with me if it’s okay with Mary.   
It’s okay, but you better be on your best behavior.   
I will, I promise.   
Go ahead.
