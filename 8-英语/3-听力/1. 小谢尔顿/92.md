Hello, George.     
What?    
I do admire your thick head of hair.    
George.    
Thanks.    
What's going on?    
Well, I'm practicing the principles in this book.    
Why?    
Well, I know Mom is concerned that I don't have any friends.    
so I'm determined to remedy the situation.    
George.    
Well, good for you.    
Do you feel complimented when I say your name, George?    
The book says you should, George.    
I suppose.    
Kind of overdoing it a little.    
Sheldon,    
well, thank you for your criticism.    
It also says I should praise any improvements that you've made.    
Okay.    
I'll get back to you.    
George.
