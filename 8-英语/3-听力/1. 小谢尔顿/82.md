Well.     
Shelly, I am very proud of you for doing so well on that test.    
But you can't go off to college.    
Mom,    
In a few years, sure.    
But right now,     
you can just keep taking your one college class with Dr.Sturgis.    
Why can't go there full-time?    
oh, baby, it's an hour away.    
We can't drive you back and forth every day.    
I'm the one who's been driving him.    
And she loves it.    
How can he be so smart,    
and so clueless at the same time?    
Dr.Sturgis lives at the school.    
What if he acted as my guardian?    
That's an idea.    
A crazy one.    
But if would only be on school nights.    
Shelly, 
What's the point of being intelligent.    
if I can't take advantage of opportunities like this?
