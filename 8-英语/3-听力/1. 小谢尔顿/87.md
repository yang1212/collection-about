Something wrong?      
How come math is easy for Sheldon and hard for me?     
I don't know, honey.     
but you have your own gifts.     
Like what?     
Well, like.     
you have very pretty hair.     
True.     
Georgie.     
Would you do me a little tiny favor?     
Like what?     
Tomorrow at lunch, would you mind sitting with your brother?     
Don't do it, Georgie.     
You stay out of this.     
I ate with him in second grade.     
It really hurt my social life.     
Sorry, mom, Can't do it.     
Why are you such a brat?     
Maybe I'm crying for attention.     
This isn't a joke, young lady.     
Yes, your brother may be smart.     
but he doesn't have a friend in the world.     
And I am sorry, but I am very worried about him.
