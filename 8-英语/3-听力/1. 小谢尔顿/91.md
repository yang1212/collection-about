So your father tells me you've been reading a new book?     
I am, It's about how to make friends.    
Is that something you're interested in?    
Not really, but Missy told me,    
it makes you sad that I don't have any.    
I got to sew that girl's mouth shut.    
So how's it going?    
Well, the principles in the book didn't work for me at all.    
Although Dad does like being called George over and over again.    
so you might give that a try.    
Baby, you don't have to go to any trouble for me.    
But I like doing things for you.    
You're a nice lady.    
But if the book's not working.    
It isn't.    
But I realized if I find the other people,    
who checked out the book,    
they'd be looking for friends, too.    
That's really smart.    
Missy thought of it.    
You're kidding.    
I'm as surprised as you are.
