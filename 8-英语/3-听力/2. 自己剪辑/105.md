Georgie?      
What?      
I'm ready to scrub the moral stain off my character.      
I hate everything about you.      
When does the truck bring the papers?      
When it does.      
That's a tautology.      
-What? -A tautology.      
A statement that's true, but uninformative.      
Hey, you're supposed to be the one teaching me.      
That's funny.      
Oh, there it is.      
Over here, Over here.      
This is exciting.      
It's something.      
Thank you. Have a great day.
