How about I give you a buck apiece?           
Let's meet in the middle... Three dollars each.          
Now we're haggling.          
Let me ask you a question.          
If you break something today,          
are you prepared to cover the cost of that?          
-No, -Nuh-uh, Mm.          
Well, we're gonna have to factor that in.          
And did you bring your own lunch?          
You said we were getting pizza.          
Well, I did, but pizza ain't free.          
And I'm teaching you about negotiating,          
which is a pretty valuable life lesson, right?          
-Yeah, -I guess so.          
So, if my math is right.          
you owe me... two dollars each.          
We owe you?          
The numbers don't lie.          
Dang it.          
All right, listen.          
I love ya, and you're family.          
So if you do it for nothing, we'll call it even.          
Take it, take it, take it.          
You got yourself a deal.          
Y'all drive a hard bargain.          
Now start bringing that crap outside.
