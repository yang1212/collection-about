Georgie, how'd you do on that math test today?    
It was tough.    
I don't know.    
I'm sorry I wasn't more help.    
Me, too.    
That's all right, baby, you tried.    
Yeah. It's okay, baby.    
I don't understand what went wrong.    
Is there any chance you drank alcohol    
when you were pregnant with Georgie?    
No.    
Well, don't be so high-and-mighty.    
I drank when I was pregnant with you.    
You turned out fine.    
These days everybody's like, "Don't drink, don't smoke."    
I swear. Texas is turning into California.    
You realize there's nothing I can do if you fail.    
You're off the team.    
I know.    
Well, I'm gonna ask Jesus    
to help you get a good grade on that test.    
Shouldn't you have asked him before he took it?    
The man rose from the dead.    
I think he can fix a test after the fact.    
You know, I hear you say things like that,    
and I wonder if maybe I did have a few too many whiskey sours    
when you were in my belly.
