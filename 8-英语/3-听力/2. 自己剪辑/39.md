Of course you're not gonna tell anybody.    
I start with a tablespoon of cumin.   
and then a cup of brown sugar, and...   
I know the recipe.   
What?   
She told it to me.   
When.   
February 14, 1982.   
I was 23 months old, it was Valentine's Day.   
and mom and day went out for dinner.   
You were there. Don't you remember?   
I got nothing.   
You can really remember when you were that little?   
Uh-hub. You were there, too.   
You were still struggling with potty training.   
I don't think so.   
Oh, yes, Meemaw used to call you Mr.Soggy Pants.   
Nuh-uh.   
Mr.Soggy Pants.   
Quit it. This is serious.   
Sheldon, you've got to tell Dad that recipe.   
But Meemaw told me it was a secret.   
If you don't. and Mom and Dad get a divorce, it's your fault.   
All right.   
Good job, Soggy pants.
