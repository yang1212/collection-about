It was his first attempt at taxidermy.         
He was so proud.         
If it has sentimental value to you.         
I'll let you have it for five dollars.         
Ooh, For this nasty thing?         
Oh, you're selling his golf clubs, too?         
Which one of your children do you see         
hanging out with Arnold Palmer in the future?         
Dad's clothes, his shoes, his pipes?         
Honey, it's just stuff.         
I know, but still...         
I get how you're feeling.         
I do.         
Now go away.         
I have a lot of crap to sell.         
All right, now, don't wander off.         
Pick you up right after the lecture's over.         
Bye.         
You gonna be okay by yourself?         
I actually prefer it.         
Yep, I'm leaving.         
You keep saying that, but then you don't do it.         
Bye.         
He's so needy.
