Does he know I'm in here?      
Attention, students are faculty.     
Oh, no.     
This is Sheldon Lee Cooper.     
What the hell?     
We've taught that hard work pays off, but that's not true.     
I came up with a solution to save Earth     
from killer asteroids,     
and lost the science fair     
to SueAnn Ludlow, and her frizzy hair machine.     
But it wasn't just me who lost, we all lost.     
Wake up, people.     
The system's broken.     
Real innovation isn't valued.     
Nowdays, it's all about flash and style.     
I blame MTV.     
Luckily, my parents can't afford cable.     
We can afford it.     
I urge you all to rise up.     
They can't send everyone to the principal's office.     
Chew gum in class, use a number one pencil,     
go nuts.     
This is Sheldon Lee Cooper signing off.     
Live long and prosper.     
You better run, you little punk.
