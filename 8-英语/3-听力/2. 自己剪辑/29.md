I figured it out.     
One night.    
I want to sleep one night.    
Oh, Hi, Mom.    
Hi there.    
With my research complete,    
and my ulcer on the mend,    
all that was left to do was send my work to NASA,    
and wait to be become America's scientific sweetheart.    
So I waited..    
and waited    
and waited    
and waited    
Something's wrong with Sheldon again.    
Now what?
