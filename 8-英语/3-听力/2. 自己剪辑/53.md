First off, I want to thank you both for coming.    
Yeah, yeah, What'd he do?    
Uh, he didn't do anything.    
Gosh, Tom, I want to believe you.    
Okay, the problem is, the curriculum here    
is not challenging enough for Sheldon.    
Now, he gets bored,    
and maybe doesn't express himself    
in the most productive way.    
And so the square of sine plus cosine equals one.    
Sheldon.    
I don't want to embarrass you.    
so I'm going to give you a moment    
to think about what you just said.    
Ms. MacElroy.    
What?    
I'm wondering if you read the book you assigned to us,    
because I did.    
20 laps.    
Cooper.    
If you're going to ask us to run.    
don't you think you shuold lead by example?
