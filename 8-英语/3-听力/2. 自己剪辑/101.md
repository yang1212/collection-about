Do you know if we have earplugs?      
If we did, I'd be wearing them.     
Go to sleep.     
I can't.     
Put your fingers in your ears.     
And risk driving wax back into my inner ear canal?     
No, thank you.     
Good morning.     
Are you trying to kill me?     
No, I think you're great.     
Then why are you in my bed?     
I couldn't sleep.     
Our refrigerator is making a weird noise.     
But so was one of your nostrils.     
so don't expect me back tonight.     
Go home before I call the police.     
You wouldn't call the police on your Moonpie.     
Then I'll call your mother.     
That you would do.
