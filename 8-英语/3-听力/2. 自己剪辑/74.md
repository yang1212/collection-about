What are you looking for?      
A brooch.      
What's a brooch?      
It's a piece of jewelry.      
In my acting book, there's an exercise.

Why?      
According to the story, it was given to me by a friend.      
So I could afford to stay in drama school, but now it's gone.      
Well, good luck finding it.      
Thanks.      
Wait.      
You really believed I was looking for something.      
I did it.      
I'm an actor.      
You're a freak.      
Oh, where the heck is that brooch?
