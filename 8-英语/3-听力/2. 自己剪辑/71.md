Welcome back.     
Thank you for seeing us on such short notice, Doctor.    
Oh, not a problem.    
Sheldon.    
I remember you.    
Do you remember me?        
I remember everything.    
Okay.    
Uh, you two, make yourselves comfortable.    
Me and my mian man Sheldon are gonna go,    
have a little chitchat in my office.    
I don't like chitchat, and I'm not your main man.    
Right on.    
Have fun.    
Now, Sheldon, I understand you've changed your mind    
about being a scientist,    
And you're gonna say I can't?    
No, I think that's great.    
-You do? -Yeah.    
I think it's improtant to keep your options open.
