All right, everybody, welcome.        
Glad to see we got so many people interested       
in radioactive decay.       
Well, hello.       
-Hi, -Hi.       
This is a nice surprise.       
I don't usually see young people at my lectures.       
I enjoyed your paper on accelerator mass spectrometry.       
and wanted to find out more.       
Is that so?       
And you?       
I read this magazine.       
It has puzzles, too.       
Okay.       
Do you want to kick this off       
and tell us exactly what carbon dating is?       
The 5,730-year half-life of carbon 14       
is used as a geochronometer.       
Anything else you'd like to add?       
Carbon dating is how we figured out how old my grandmother is.       
It was at this moment I learned       
I was not only brilliant, I was also hilarious.
