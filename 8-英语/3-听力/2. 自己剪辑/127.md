Missy, we're gonna eat in a restaurant.       
Where would you like to go?      
I get to pick?      
Why don't I get to pick?      
Because your sister's getting to pick.      
It's not just about you in this house.      
What do you think, baby?      
I pick...      
Red Lobster.      
You got it.      
George, you got a minute?      
-What's up? -Not you.      
-him, -What?      
Sheldon told me that we get paid to go to that college,      
and answer their questions.      
Yeah, so?      
I want to know how much we're making.      
Why?      
Because I want my fair share.      
Is that so?      
What do you think your fair share is?      
Half.      
Hm, guess that sounds right.      
So how much are we making?      
$7.50 a week.      
-Really? -Really.      
Well, I want half that.      
Which is?      
Hang on.      
Sheldon.
