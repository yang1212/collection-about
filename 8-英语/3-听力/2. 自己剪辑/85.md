My new adult responsibilities began that night.     
Luckily, a cookbook is nothing more

No, Let him handle this on his own.     
I wouldn't mind watching.

If she's going, I'm going.     
No one's going anywhere.     
If he needs help, he can ask.     
I don't need help.     
Everything's under control.     
You're really holding the line on this one.     
I'm sorry, but he just pushed my buttons.     
Don't be sorry, I'm digging it.     
Gross.     
I agree.     
Pretty gross.
