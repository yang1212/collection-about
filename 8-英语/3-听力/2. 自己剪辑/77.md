Well, I need you to look after him.     
Why?    
because I'm your mother, and I'm asking you nicely.    
What if I don't want to?    
I don't care, you're doing it.    
How was that nice?    
So there I was flying above the city,    
but when I woke up, I couldn't fly.    
That's like the dream you had where you were dating Madonna,    
but when you woke up, you weren't.    
Exactly.    
You ever have the ones where your teeth are falling out?    
Better my teeth than my hair, but...    
-Sheldon? -Over here.    
-What are you doing? -Hiding.    
From who?    
Is Billy the one giving you trouble?    
No.    
His dad?    
No.    
No...    
She's a demon.
