Meemaw, could you take me to Radio Shack?   
Sure, maybe later.   
Later is a little vague.   
Could you please be more specific?   
Well, I’m good and ready. How’s that?   
Better, but I’m really like to nail this down.   
Why don’t you ask your father to take you?   
Dad, what?   
Can you please take me to Radio Shack?   
I’m busy, ask your Meemaw.   
I did, she said to ask you.   
Well, ask her again.   
Seems counterintuitive, but all right.   
Meemaw.   
Oh, Lord.
