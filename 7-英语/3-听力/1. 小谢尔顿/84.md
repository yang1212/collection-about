I'd like to talk to you about my opponent.     
Sheldon Cooper has been lobbying for,     
new science equipment here at Medford High,     
and while that sounds wonderful, the truth is,     
he thinks our school wastes its money on football.     
Do we really want a class president who doesn't care about football?     
No.     
I know I am proud to be a Medford High cheerleader,     
and I love football.     
But you know the one thing,     
I love more than football?     
God.     
Let me tell you another interesting fact about my opponent.     
Did you know that Sheldon Cooper is an atheist?     
That's right.     
He doesn't believe in God.     
Just keep that in mind.     
when you cast your vote today.     
I'm Nell Cavanaugh, Go Wolves.
