Stop.      
You're not fighting Tommy, you're fighting me.     
oh, boy.     
unless you want to shake hands,     
and we all laugh about this over a glass of milk.     
I think I'd rather kick both your asses.     
I was afraid you'd say that.     
Are you familiar with the story of David and Goliath from the Bible?     
Yeah.     
That's too bad.     
I had a nice speech prepared.     
I'll say it anyway.     
You may have the size advantage.     
but like David and his sling,     
I also possess an air-based weapon.     
So I'll give you one more chance.     
Are you willing to step down?     
I'll tell you what,     
you take the first shot, then it's my turn.     
very well.
