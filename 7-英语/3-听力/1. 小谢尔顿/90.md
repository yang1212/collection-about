98,99,100.    
You missed 11 numbers.    
I don't need to be good at math.    
I have beautiful hair.    
That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.    
Didn't you already read that book?    
I'm reading it again.    
How come?    
I clearly missed something.    
I couldn't find one person who wanted to be my friend.    
Did you look at the card inside?    
why?    
That's just other people who checked out the book.    
It's a list of losers like you who can't find a friend.    
So?    
So they're desperate.    
and you have their names.    
That's brilliant.    
Now, how is it that you can't count?
