I forgot to tell you, a girl called for you.    
What girl?    
I don't know, A girl.    
Well, what'd she say?    
It's hard to remember, This was months ago.    
Two cases?    
You've got to be kidding me.    
Don't worry, I didn't use your money.    
I used mine.    
Finish your dinner and then pack a bag.    
We are going to Meemaw's.        
Why?    
because your mom and dad need a break from each other.    
For how long?    
I don't know, Just pack.    
Will I need earmuffs?    
Sure, if you want.
