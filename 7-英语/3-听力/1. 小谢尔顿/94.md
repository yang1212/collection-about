We need to have a talk.    
Georgie, get in here.    
Are we in trouble?    
No one's in trouble.    
What's going on?    
Have a seat.    
You're also getting talked to.    
Sit.    
okay.    
Dr.Sturgis will be joining us for dinner.    
Hot darn.    
That guy's back?    
I thought he was in the nut house.    
We do not call it that.    
That's what Dad calls it.    
And that's why I made him sit.    
We need to make sure that Dr.Sturgis feels comfortable.    
And how are we supposed to do that?    
For startes, do not bring up his time in the hospital.    
What if he brings it up?    
You let the grown-ups handle that.    
In this scenario, am I one of the grown-ups?    
No.    
Great.    
You also will not stare at him during dinner.    
Can I look at him at all?    
Yes.
