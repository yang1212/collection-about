Hello, I'd like to speak to the mayor, please.    
My name is Sheldon Cooper.   
I'm running for class president,   
and was hoping he could give me some advice.   
I'm ten years old.   
But if it helps get him on the phone,   
I'm well-behaved, a straight-A student,   
and have impeccable hygiene.   
Hello.   
This is Mayor Harrison.   
I understand you are running for office.   
Class president.   
Do you have any advice on how to win?   
The most important thing is to get out there,   
and connect with people.   
That's tricky.   
I'm not terribly fond of people.   
Well, you might need to get over that.   
Assuming I can.   
How do I connect with them?   
A friendly handshake is a great start.   
oh, boy.   
Now I have to touch them?
