mom, please.   
sheldon Lee, I said no.   
I'm still happy.   
please Mom, you're being unfair.   
no, but I really need those thrust-to-weight ratios.   
Do you see I'm cooking?   
well, take me after dinner.   
enough, I'm not taking you anywhere tonight.   
I'm not proud of it.   
but as a child, I was prone to the occasional meltdown.   
cheese and crackers.   
I'm sorry you had to hear that.
