Dad, you need to take me home.   
Why? What’s the matter?   
I don’t have my safety goggles, let’s go.   
Sheldon, I’m busy.   
You’re just watching tv.   
I’m reviewing game tape.   
So you know how it ends,   
I’ll meet you at the car.   
Sheldon, I’m not driving you home.   
I got practice in 20 minutes.   
Then call Mom and tell her to bring them to me.   
She’s working, too.   
But I need my goggles.   
Then use the ones in class.   
And I don’t want to hear about eyebrow lice.   
The ones in class are too big for me.   
What if they fall off and something happens to my eyes?   
If I go blind, I’ll need a seeing eye dog.   
And I’m  scared of dogs.   
Is this how you plan on acting when you get to college?   
No.   
Good, because you’re gonna need to handle stuff like this on your own.   
I can handle it.   
I hope so.
