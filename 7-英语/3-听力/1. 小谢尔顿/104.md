Hello, I'm Sheldon Cooper, and this is        
"Why Sheldon Cooper Should Go to College".       
Which is why I'm proposing that I live at home.       
but enroll full-time to continue my studies       
with Dr.Sturgis at East Texas Tech.       
Hi, Mary.       
I know this must be a hard decision for you.       
but if your let him come here.       
I promise we'll take good care of him.       
Sheldon Cooper ready for college, ready to change the world.       
Cut.       
If that doesn't convince her, I don't know what her problem is...
