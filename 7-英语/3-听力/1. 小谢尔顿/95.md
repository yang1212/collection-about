Shely, can you turn the TV off for a second?     
But after this commercial break,     
Professor Proton is going to use a candle,     
to suck a hard-boiled egg into a milk bottle.     
We'll make it quick.     
Go ahead.     
Your father has something to tell you.     
Your mother wants you to swim.     
George.     
Mom.     
Who's ready to suck eggs?     
That was the lamest tantrum I've ever seen.     
I'm being forced to swim tomorrow in P.E.     
Poor baby, you have to play in a pool instead of sit in a classroom.     
A pool of sweat,germs and dead skin cells.     
Still better than learning.     
Maybe it's time for me to run away from home,     
and join a traveling math club.     
Just pretend to be sick.     
But that would be lying.     
I'm not a liar.     
Well, you better be a swimmer.
