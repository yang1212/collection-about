Okay.      
There he is, there's my baby.     
Hey, buddy, How you feeling?     
I brought you some comic books.     
Hi, Moonpie.     
Hi, Meemaw.     
Where's your gallbladder?     
I want to see it.     
They throw it away, honey.     
Why?     
Can I go home now?     
No, baby, they need to keep you here a little while,     
make sure you're okay.     
Overnight?     
Actually, a few nights.     
no, tell them I'm going home.     
Shelly, the doctors know what's best for you.     
What's best for me is to be at home,     
in my own bed, with my books and my computer.     
well, I can bring you whatever you want.     
Just-just tell me.     
I just told you, bring me home.     
Moonpie, you're looking at the all wrong.     
You got your own room here, your own TV.     
Is no one listening to me?     
I want to go home.     
I'm listening, but I have no say in this.
