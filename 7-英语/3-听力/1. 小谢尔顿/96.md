Hey, Shelly, I got something for you.    
What is it?    
An invitation to Billy Sparks's birthday on Saturday.    
Isn't that nice?    
Sheldon's gonna go?    
A child's birthday party?    
No, thank you.    
Great.    
You're going to Billy's party.    
But I don't want to.    
And I don't want him to.    
Too bad, he's going.    
Then I don't want to go.    
Everyone's going and everyone's gonna have fun.    
This is so unfair.    
It is, you should run away from home.
