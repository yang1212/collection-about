My head is so hot.     
She is such a hoot.    
-You okay? -Fine.    
Okay. don't tell me.    
So hot...    
I don't like you making me out to be the bad guy    
Just because I won't let my daughter do whatever she wants.    
I gave you a lot of freedom.    
you turned out okay.    
You didn't give me freedom.        
You were never around.    
Is that so?    
I guarantee I made supper for Charlene and Edward    
more times than you ever did.    
I basically raised them.    
You think I was out dancing?    
I was out working tow jobs so your daddy could    
lose all our money on that damn chain of Fotomats.    
It wasn't Daddy's fault that those little things blew over    
every time there was a storm.    
Seriously, I'm melting.
