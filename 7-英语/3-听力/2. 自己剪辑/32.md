I've often contemplated what might have happened,     
if my father hadn't stuck up for me that day.     
Would I have gone on to become     
a world-class theoretical physicist.     
or just your average Joe Sixpack theoretical physicist?     
Dadï¼Ÿ     
Yeah.     
Thank you.     
You're welcome.     
We're real proud of you, honey.     
Are you proud of me and Georgie?     
of course.     
You bet.     
For what?     
Don't go poking at it.
