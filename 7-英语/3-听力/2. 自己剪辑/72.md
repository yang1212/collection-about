Let me tell you a little story,      
about an extremely smart yound boy.     
Me?     
Me.     
For the longest time.     
I thought I was gonna be     
a professional figure skater.     
And then you became disenchanted with the field like I did?     
Exactly?     
Someone skated right over my foot.     
And that was that.     
I'm not sure that's the same thing.     
I'd say you lost your passion the way I lost my big toe.     
Don't draw in that.     
Hey, We're all done.     
-How'd it go? -Great.     
I feel a lot better.     
Well, that's just wonderful.     
So, you're going back to science?     
No, In fact, I'm going as far away from science as possible.     
I plan to pursue the arts.     
What kind of arts?     
I've decided to become an actor.     
Of course you have.
