How's it going?     
Good.     
Did you know that Zoroaster believed in two gods?     
No, I did not.     
And the Taoists don't believe in God at all.     
They believe in a principle of harmony.     
How very nice for them.     
Shelly, I understand you enjoy researching things.     
Love it.     
But it's important to keep in mind.     
that there is only one true God.     
That's called monotheism.     
I have a book about it if you're interested.     
That's okay, I have the book about it.     
Would you be angry with me if I don't pick your religion?     
I could never be angry with you.     
You be a seeker of your own truth.     
Thanks, Mom.
