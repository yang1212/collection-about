So I get what you're going through.     
But you'll notice, I didn't come home and take it out on you.     
No, you didn't.     
I want you to get back in there.     
apologize to everyone, and finish your dinner.     
yes, sir.     
My father's wisdom touched me deeply.     
Which is why,  to this day.     
no matter what I'm going through.     
I am never irritating or abusive     
to any of my friends or loved ones.          
Ask them, They'll tell you.     
For the next several months.          
I continued working my paper route,     
until I paid my father back.     
And by working, I mean deligating.     
I've no idea where I am.
