I don't care if you win, just cover the damn spread.    
Mom, are you betting again?    
No.    
Fourth down.    
Gotta punt.    
Gotta.    
Statistically, always punting on fourth down    
makes no sense.    
Statistically, you're a dumbass.    
When the Aggies give up the ball,    
on their own five-yard line,    
the opposing team has a 92% chance of scoring.    
When they punt from deep in their own territory.    
the other team still has a 77% chance of scoring.    
But since they convert on fourth down 50% of the time.    
the math says they should never punt again.    
Okay, you can tell me,    
Who's his real daddy?
