Moving on.     
Metaphors are different from similes.    
I've been called a germophobe,    
but I do find a single sneeze acceptable.    
It could be caused by dust, allergies.    
really, whatever nasal irritant floats your boat.    
However...    
during flu season...    
a second sneeze means a plague is upon the land,    
and it's every man for himself.    
Where do you think you're going?    
Away from you.    
Why's that?    
I want to live.    
I'm not sick. Get back in your seat.    
No, thank you.    
You know the rules.    
You can't leave without a hall pass.    
May I have a hall pass?    
No, you may not.    
Now get back in your seat.    
Rules are the pillars of society.    
I love rules.    
But what benefit are rules to a dead man?
