I'm putting a dog.     
I've conquered my phobia.    
You're a good boy, yes, you are.    
I'm sorry for the unkind things I said to you.    
Me, too.    
Connie?    
What?    
Anything you'd like to say?    
Not particularly.    
Mom.    
Okay.    
I'm sorry for the things I said.    
And, you know, what happened at the bowling alley.    
As am I.    
Here.    
I think this came out of your head.    
He licked me, He licked me.    
The dog licked my tongue.    
I can still taste it.    
Call 911.
