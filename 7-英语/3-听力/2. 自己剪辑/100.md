Some people have said I'm overly sensitive.       
What now?      
Missy gave me cinnamon gum.      
Sure, sure.      
And by some people, I mean everyone.      
While I may not be X-Men material...      
I have always possessed unusually heightened senses.      
Georgie, put your shoes back on.      
He can't smell this.      
Yes, I can.      
I also had extraordinary hearing.      
During dinner, I could tune out the cacophony of chewing.      
slurping.      
chewing, cutlery scraping against plates,      
chewing.      
and my father's heavy breathing      
as he wrestled with a ketchup bottle.
