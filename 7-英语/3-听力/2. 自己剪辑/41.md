Hey, pal.    
Playing with your rockets?   
I'm trying to calculate ballistic coefficients.   
Well, that's fun, too.   
Listen, I don't have to work this weekend.   
I was wondering if you wanted to do something together.   
Like what?   
Whatever you want.   
Well, the filter on my air purifier needs to be changed.   
How about a trip to Sears?   
Yeah, I was thinking along the lines of something a little more active.   
Like last year.   
we went fishing...   
Mom, Dad's trying to make me go fishing.   
No, no, it's okay.   
We're not going fishing.   
All right, good.   
But seriously.   
was fishing really that bad?   
Mom, Dad's trying to convince me   
that fishing wasn't that bad.   
Shh, come on.   
Forget I said anything about fishing.   
Just think about it.   
and we'll do whatever you want.   
Thank you.
