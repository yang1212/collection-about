Ira, you're just a wonderful man.        
Oh, boy, I don't like where this is going.       
But to tell you the truth.       
I'm seeing somebody else.       
And we've gone there.       
I thought I could do it, uh... you know, date both of you.       
but I-I can't, I can't, I just...       
I'm not cut out for it.       
Okay, suggestion.       
And maybe you've already thought of this...       
but what do you say you break up with him       
and only see me?       
I'm sorry.       
I thought I could handle this.       
-It's okay, -You know.       
you get older, and you think your skin is thicker...       
-It's okay, -and your heart is tougher.       
But it's not, it's the other way around.       
I hope this guy knows what a gift he has in you.       
Well, "gift" is a strong word.       
but he's enthusiastic.       
Good.       
May you both be very happy together.
