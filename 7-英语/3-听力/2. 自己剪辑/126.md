Okay, very good, Let's look at another picture.       
I'm not done, The monkey in the painting.      
is wearing an old lady hat.      
so she's probably a meemaw monkey.      
She's not at the party.      
so she must be bowling or dead.      
Well, Missy won that round.      
It's actually not a contest, George.      
This is Texas, Everything's a contest.      
A woman in a doorway.      
Anything else?      
She's holding her head with her hand.      
And what do you think that means?      
Wouldn't you rather ask me about trains going to St.Louis?      
Good gravy, she's sad, Sheldon, come on.      
Oh, she's very upset.      
I don't know why.      
Oh, Maybe she wasn't invited      
to the tea party at the monkey house.      
Also, she's wearing a belt, like you are.      
Nice going, Very cute.      
Thank you.      
And I'm loving the hair.
