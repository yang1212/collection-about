Hey, what you reading?     
A magazine.    
Oh, Making a collage for school?    
No, just reading it.    
Look at that.    
Maybe Sheldon isn't the only bookworm around here.    
Which magazine?    
-Cosmopolitan.  -What?    
It's a magazine for today's woman.    
Hey, I was about to find out what turns a man on.    
Where'd you get this?    
Heather. I traded a Fruit Roll-up for it.    
-Well, this is going in the garbage.    
-You sure?    
It's got some great tips on how to spice up your marriage.    
My marriage is fine, thank you.    
And you are not to bring filth like this into our house again.    
That's not fair, Sheldon reads dirty stuff all the time,    
and you don't say anything.    
He does not.    
Check out the comic book on his desk.    
What?    
Oh, my goodness.    
Oh, my.    
Hold on.    
No. No.
