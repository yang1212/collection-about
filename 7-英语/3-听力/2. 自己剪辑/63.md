What are you doing?      
Nothing.      
Is that chewing tobacoo?      
It's chocolate Bazooka. What do you want?      
I have detention tomorrow.      
and I thought you could give me some tips.      
That was pretty badass, you walking out of class like that.      
It was not my intention to be bad "a" word, but thank you.      
The only thing you need to worry about in detention      
is staying close to the teacher.      
If he leaves the room, you go with him.      
Why?      
Because you're gonna get your "a" word kicked.      
Are you saying I'll be in physical danger?      
It's all the worst kids in school      
in one room for an hour.      
What do you think's gonna happen?      
I thought we were gonna spend the time regretting our actions      
and thinking about how we could be better in the future.      
Well, you thought wrong. Get lost.      
You're both mean and nice to me.      
It's confusing.
