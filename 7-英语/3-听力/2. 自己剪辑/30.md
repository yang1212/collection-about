Yeah, I don't mean to be rude.     
but we've been waiting for an hour to see your boss.    
I'm sorry, sir.    
but you didn't have an appointment.    
we didn't have an appointment, because every time I called.    
you put me on hold.    
I'm sure Dr.Hodges will see you as soon as he can.    
-So, what do you want to do? -I don't know.    
I guess we just got to be patient and wait...    
Aw, screw it.    
Excuse me, sir, you can't just...    
All right, here's the deal.    
My kids got a damn ulcer because of you.    
so either you take him seriously,    
or you gonna be taking me seriously.    
Yes, sir?    
Janice, why don't you send little boy in?    
Right away.    
He'll see you now.    
You're up, Moonpie.
