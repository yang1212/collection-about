I'm sure you're well aware we have a student with us,     
who, despite his young age,    
is remarkably gifted.    
And I expect you all to make him feel welcome.    
Yes, sheldon?    
Per the student dress and grooming code,    
this boy's hair is too long,    
this boy is wearing sports attire outside of a designated area,    
and this girl's blouse is diaphanous,    
which means I can see her brassiere.    
Thank you.    
I will take that into account.    
All right.
