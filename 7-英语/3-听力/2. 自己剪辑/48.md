Georgie?     
Dad told me to help you study for the math test.     
I don't need you help, Get lost.     
Georgie, let him help you.     
Fine, come in.     
Oh, dear.     
What's your problem?     
No problem. I'll just...     
tidy while we talk.     
Help yourself.     
Before we start, I'd like to get a sense     
of how much algebra you know.     
Okay.     
Do you understand solving graphing linear inequalities?     
Sure.     
Great, Explain it to me.     
First you solve them...     
and then you graph them.     
And how do you do that?     
Uh, you know.     
carefully.     
Excuse me.     
$20 isn't gonna do it.
