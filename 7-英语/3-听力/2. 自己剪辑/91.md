If there's a weird kid in the neighborhood.       
it's your grandson.     
Now, hang on, I said "special", not "weird".     
I heard you.     
I said "weird".     
Okay, see now, Brenda.     
you don't want to go calling my grandson weird.     
when I've just treated you to a margarita grande.     
Well, I'm sorry, but you shouldn't be inferring     
there's something wrong with my Billy.     
Darling, there's no inferring.     
I've seen the boy sitting in the dirt     
eating his own belly button lint.     
Really, Mom? This is how you put out the fire?     
Well, at least she got the worst of it.     
How you figure that?     
I ripped a big patch of hair out of her head.     
This will be healed in a week.     
She will be wearing a hat till Laber Day.     
I want to be just like you when I grow up.     
-No, you don't. -Pick again.
