But one day a year, the gymnasium was transformed     
into a haven of learning.    
thanks to a remarkable institution    
known as the science fair.    
A chance for the student body to come together    
in the name of research and progress.    
Uh, while some did the bare minimum...    
and others preferred razzamatazz over raw data,    
I set out to save humanity from deadly asteroids.    
And made it all neatly fit on three poster boards.    
The science fair may be a competition,    
but when the goal is promoting knowledge, we're all winners.    
And the winner        
of the Medford High School Science Fair is...    
SueAnn Ludlow.    
You've got to be kidding me.    
Shelly.    
You people are crazy.    
Hey, All right.    
You're celebrating mediocrity.    
Mediority.    
Mediority.
