Ohï¼ŒMeemaw, no.               
Hey, who are you calling?             
Dr.Sturgis.             
Why?             
I saw Meemaw get in a car with Mr.Rosenbloom.             
No.             
I don't know if it really happened this way.             
but to my nine-year-old mind.             
my mother was flying.             
Your grandmother's a single lady.             
She's not committed to any one fella,             
and she wants to see what her options are.             
But Dr.Sturgis is the best option.             
Well, you might feel that way.             
but she's not so sure.             
Then we need to tell her, I'll make the call.             
No, we need to mind our business.             
And maybe pray for her to make the right decision.             
We're gonna leave this up to God?             
You think you could do a better job than God?
