How you feeling, baby?    
Remember the tuna sandwich I had at the bus station?    
Yeah.    
Worse than that.    
oh, honey, I'm sorry.    
I'm sure you'll feel better in the morning.    
Hey, Mom, you know how twins can feel each others pain?    
You're going to school tomorrow.    
I think she's getting smarter.    
Relax, he's sleeping.    
How come when I'm sick it's no big deal.        
but when Sheldon gets sick,            
you act like it's the end of the world?    
Because he's a fragile little boy.    
and you're getting to be a big strong man.    
That's true.    
Puberty has done right by me.    
Mom, Something's really wrong with Sheldon.    
We need a doctor here.    
In that moment, I was in too much pain,    
to tell my father,     
I told you so.    
But for years after,    
I reminded him constantly.
