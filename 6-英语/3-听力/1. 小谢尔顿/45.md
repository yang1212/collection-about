The train museum is looking for a docent.    
what's a docent?    
It's a person in a museum who gives information on the exhibits.    
Do you think they'd let someone your age do that?    
why not? I have a high school diploma.    
True.    
I know more about trains than anybody.    
True.    
And I have the unique ability to wear people down until I get my way.    
So true.    
Hello, I understand you're looking for a docent.    
Iâ€™m 11 years old,     
but your should know I have a high school diploma,    
and I know more about trains than anybody.    
You still sound on the fence.    
It was time to break out my unique ability.    
Let me tell you about every model train I own and what each of them means to me.    
The first locomotive I ever received..    
Wouldn't you know it, 47 short minutes later.    
I got the job.
