What are you doing?      
Trying to calculate the odds of the Dolphins.      
covering the spread next Sunday.      
I like dolphins.      
They talk out of that hole in their head.      
Hello.      
Tam?      
What are you doing here?      
Would you like to go to a party with me?      
I don't want to go to a party with anyone.      
I would.      
Please, Sheldon.      
It's right across the street.      
Just get me in, and you can go back to bed.      
I have to ask my mom.      
No need, she knows all about the party.      
All right, then.      
I need a minute to change.
