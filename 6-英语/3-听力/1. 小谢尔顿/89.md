I suppose I could have been doing that to avoid dealing,     
with the fear of change.     
and moving would certainly be a big change.     
That's very astute.     
I'd have a new room in a new house,     
and the new house would probably have a different smell.     
and I probably wouldn't like that smell.     
because I don't like new smells.     
and I'd be going to a new school with new kids and new teachers,     
and I bet they'd all smell different, as well.     
Okay, now calm down.

Your olfactory senses aren't about to be assaulted by the state of Oklahoma.     
Okay, let's try a different approach.     
Can I take you to get some ice cream?     
I'm having an emotional crisis, Meemaw.     
You can't fix that with ice cream.     
Right, Sorry.     
You want to go to Radio Shack?     
Yes, I want to go to Radio Shack.
