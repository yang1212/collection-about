I'm ready to go to college.   
okay, where you thinking?   
somewhere with a good science program.   
but far enough away to make my mom cry herself to sleep every night that Iâ€˜m gone.   
you're applying to college out of spite?   
I see why you're the guidance counselor.   
okay, let's see.   
what about Caltech in Pasadena?   
I can't see myself living in California.    
I don't trust their carefree lifestyle.    
okay, um...    
how about MIT in Boston?    
do they have a strong physics program?    
they're more of an engineering school.    
next.
