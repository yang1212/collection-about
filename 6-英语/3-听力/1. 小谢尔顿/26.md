Just do yourself a favor, okay?   
Go to school tomorrow and mind your own business.

Dad.   
Are you sad that you got fired?   
Mostly angry.   
But yeah.   
Maybe a little sad.   
All right, let’s say grace.   
Thank you, god, for this food we are about to receive.   
That was the first time I held my father’s hand.
