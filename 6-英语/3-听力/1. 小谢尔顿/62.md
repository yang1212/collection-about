Tam, I have a secret that's weighing on me.    
and I need to tell someone.    
Okay, tell me.    
But I promised I wouldn't.    
Okay, Then don't.    
But it's driving me crazy.    
Too bad you're not Catholic.    
You could confess it to a priest.    
That's a great idea.    
You're Catholic, I'll confess it to you.    
I'm not a priest.    
I'm not a Catholic.    
It makes perfect sense.    
Okay, whenever you're ready.    
What are you doing?    
I'm assuming the position.    
Okay.    
Forgive me, Tam, for I have sinned.    
This is my first confession.    
I forgive you, my son.
