Hey, Just finishing up.
See you again soon.
How you doing?
All right, I guess.
Uh, Dale here?
He went to go hang out with my meemaw, who, by the way.
is at my house all weekend, so that's a no-go.
Okay.
What do you want to do later?
Movies? Putt-putt?
I was thinking maybe we could go get a test.
What kind of test?
The... pregnancy kind.
We're closed.
But the sign says..
We're closed.
This can't be happening, How sure are you?
I'm not sure, That's why I want to get the test.
Well, you don't look pregnant.
That's no how it works, Georgie.
I know, I'm just freaking out right now.
Let's just go to the drugstore.
Right.
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
Please don't say that.
