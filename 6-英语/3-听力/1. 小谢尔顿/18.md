Hey there, Sheldon, what can I do for you?   
I’m wondering if you have any books on stopping bad habits.   
A few, what habit are you trying to stop?   
-science, -yowza.   
It’s not permanent.   
I’m just looking to take a break.   
I’ve heard that one before.   
What did you take a break from?   
Happiness.   
Okay.   
I’ve tried a few different activities.   
But whatever I do just leads me back to science.   
Well, let’s think about it.    
What’s the opposite of science?   
Science is based in facts.   
And the opposite of facts is fiction.   
How about fantasy?   
Magic and dragons.   
We have a whole section here.   
Ooh, that sounds intellectually bankrupt.   
I’ll give it a shot.
