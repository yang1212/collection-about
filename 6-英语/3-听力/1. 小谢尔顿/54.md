Sheldon, can you come in here for a minute?     
Yes.    
Have a seat, We want to talk to you.    
All right.    
So today we found out about a school in Dallas for really smart kids.    
When can I start?    
Hold on, Dalls is far away.    
so you'd have to live with another family.    
Do they have a dog?    
Uh, we don't know.    
Well, can you make some calls?    
I guess, but wouldn't you miss your mom and dad?    
Yes, I suppose I will.    
So, when are you calling about the dog?    
You know him so well.
