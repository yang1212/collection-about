My son, the college freshman, I can't believe it.      
How can you not believe it?      
You had to sign my vaccination form.      
Right.      
So, what do you want to do first?      
I was thinking we could start at the bookstore.      
try and beat the lines.      
I agree about the lines, but what do you mean "we"?      
I mean you and me.      
This is my first day,       
I can't be seen walking around campus with my mommy.      
Well, it's only orientation.      
Yes, and I'm quite capable of handling everything.      
that I need to get done today on my own.      
I'm sure you are, I just figured, with Dr.Sturgis not around.      
it might be nice if I could be.      
No one else's mother is going to be.      
You don't know that.      
Well, I know mine isn't.      
You might want to watch the attitude to the person who's driving you there.      
Not all the way there, Drop me off a block away.      
so no one sees us together.      
Sorry, I am not leaving you alone your first day.      
Yes, you are.      
For someone going into college, you are acting very childish.      
Maybe it just appears that way, because you see me with my mommy.
