What the hell were you doing our there?    
George, language.   
What language?   
So?   
I was exploring dimensional kinematics.   
Admit it, he's adopted.   
How can I be adopted when I have a twin sister?   
Think, monkey, think.   
That's enough.   
No one's adopted.   
I wish I was.   
That can still be arranged.   
Now, let's pray.   
A moment, please.   
Leave him be.   
He can hold hands with his family.   
It won't kill him.   
We don't know that.   
Georgie, did you wash your hands before dinner,   
or even this week?   
None of your business.   
Hence the mittens.
