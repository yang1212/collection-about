They're walking up the path.    
They see me.    
I'm waving.    
They waved back.    
They're close to the door.    
Even closer.    
Almost there.    
Door, bell.    
Remember everything we talked about.    
Welcome.    
Look who I brought.    
Hello.    
Come in, come in.    
It's so good to see you.    
I don't normally do this, but..    
put her there.    
No mitten, I'm honored.    
It's just so wonderful to see you all again.    
We've been looking forward to it.    
We sure have.    
One Mississippi, two Mississippi.    
uh, why are you counting?    
You know Shelly, He loves his number.    
Let's say grace.
