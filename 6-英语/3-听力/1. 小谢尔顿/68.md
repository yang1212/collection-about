Sheldon.   
Oh, hi, Georgie.   
Why was Veronica Duncan hugging you?   
I'm tutoring her in trigonometry.   
And that gets you hugs?   
Thanks to me, she got her first c-minus.   
Just between us, she's a little slow.   
That's not what I heard.   
What did you hear?   
is she secretly clever?   
Because if she is, I completely missed it.   
It doesn't matter.   
You just need to introduce me to her.   
Why?   
I want to be her friend.   
Well, you better take a number.   
she's friends with a lot of boys around here.   
Let me worry about that.   
You just need to introduce us.   
All right.
