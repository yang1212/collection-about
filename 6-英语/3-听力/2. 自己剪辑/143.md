Did you guys know Paige speaks three languages?       
Really? That's impressive.      
You only speak one.      
Two, I'm learning conversational Klingon.      
That's impressive, too.      
Hey, mom, can Paige sleep over this weekend?      
I guess, if her mother says okay.      
Wait, where is she going to sleep?      
In your bed. You can sleep on the couch.      
Absolutely not.       
I've already changed my brand of loafers.      
I am not changing my sleeping quarters.      
How about you stay at Meemaw's? You like that.      
No, Meemaw has a date.      
So?      
So if those shoes I just bought do their job.      
that will be a "No children allowed" scenario.      
Well, I'm sleeping in my bed, and that's that.      
Fine, Paige and I can share my bed.      
You okay with that, Shelly?      
I trust you two will stay quiet throughout the evening      
and go to sleep at the appropriate time?      
Absolutely.
