So, Sheldon wants a computer?     
Ever since he could talk.    
But now more than ever.    
Well, he should get a job after school.    
Save up and buy one.    
Get a job? He's nine.    
I mowed lawns when I was his age.    
Made pretty good money.    
You want Sheldon to mow lawns?    
He's so pale, five minutes in the sun.    
He'd burst into flames.    
I would pay to see that.   
Shut up, Georgie.   
I hope you told him we can't afford it.   
Of course.   
I could buy it for him.   
and then y'all could pay me back when you can.   
Okay, Connie, now you're just insulting me.   
Well, that was not my intention.   
but I'm glad to hear it.   
I can pay my own bills   
and take care of my family.   
There are expenses we could cut back on   
so we could afford a computer.   
You mean like the money you give to church?   
No, I mean like the money you give to the Lone Star Beer company.   
Good one, Mom.   
-Shut up. -Shut up, pumpkin.   
We're not getting a computer. We don't need your money.   
Where are you going?   
To get a... glass of milk.   
He's lying. He's getting a beer.   
Shut up, Georgie.
