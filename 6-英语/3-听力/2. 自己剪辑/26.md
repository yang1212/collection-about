Hey, how come you weren't in math class?     
That guy from NASA treated me like a child.    
and I need to prove him wrong.    
You are a child.    
Tread lightly, my friend.    
Was Ms.Ingram upset I wasn't in class?    
Actually, she was happy.    
She even did a little dance.    
Do you know anybody with a modem?    
I think Radio Shack has one. why?    
I need to access thrust-to-weight ratios,    
from the FTP sever at the Johnson Space Center.    
Then what?    
Then I show that guy from NASA my work,    
and laugh as he begs for mercy.    
You know, sometimes you sound like a super villain.    
Silence.    
That'll be more effective after your voice changes.    
Silence.
