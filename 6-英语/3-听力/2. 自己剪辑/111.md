You kids are special, too.      
Do you feel special?    
At least I'm the only daughter.    
You got nothing.    
And she's such a know-it-all.    
Yeah, you mentioned that.    
I'm surprised her arm wasn't sore from raising her hand so much.    
Yep, sure.    
And who goes to college with stickers on their notepad?    
I don't know.    
Unicorn stickers.    
And we're home.    
Hey, Shelly.    
Guess who's coming over tomorrow?    
Your new friend Paige.    
Okay, I'm gonna go.    
Come on, Shelly, Maybe you'll end up being friends.    
I don't like her.    
I'm not going to like her, and Tam is my friend.    
I don't need another one.    
You can have more that one friend.    
I'm sure Tam has other friends.     
No, I'm all he's got.     
And even I avoid him half the time.
