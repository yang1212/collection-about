Go play.     
Go play? if only life were that simple.    
There, I played.    
Hey, Sheldon.    
Hello, Billy Sparks.    
Hello, Matilda Sparks.    
I heard you're going to high school tomorrow.    
I am.    
You're going to have to find someone else,    
to torment on the playground.    
Torment?    
It means to maliciously harass.    
Herass.    
That's funny.    
Well, this was nice.    
Hey, doofus.    
Mom.
