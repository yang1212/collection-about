Sheldon?       
Paige?     
I'm so happy to see you.     
Are you happy to see me?     
Not immediately.     
That's okay.     
I'm happy enough for both of us.     
George?     
Hi.     
Oh, Paige's mom.     
I know.     
What a nice surprise.     
I just dropped Paige off at the carbon-dating lecture.     
And I dropped Sheldon.     
Well, how about that?     
How about it.     
Mind if I join you?     
Sure.     
So, uh, where's your... your hubby?     
-Oh, Barry? -Barry, Yeah.     
Who cares?     
That doesn't sound good.
