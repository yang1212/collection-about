Mom.         
since Sheldon cost you all that money.     
who's your new favorite, me or Georgie?     
You know I don't have favorites.     
Yeah, right.     
Ok, whoever takes the trash out first is my favorite.     
She thinks we're stupid.     
Dad, I'm pleased to tell you.     
I've got a job to pay back my debt.     
Is that so?     
I'm going to be a paperboy.     
Well, that's great.     
I'm proud of ya.     
How do you plan on delivering these papers?     
Bicycle,     
You don't know how to ride a bicycle.     
These's nothing I can't learn.     
A week ago, I didn't know how to take apart a refrigerator.     
He can't deliver newspapers.     
Why not?     
It's too dangerous.     
I think you're being a little overprotective.
