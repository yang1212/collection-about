I'm seeking people who want to make friends.    
I wasn't interested in friends.    
I took out that book to help me become school principal.    
Did it work?    
Are we sitting in the principal's office?    
No.    
And you know why?    
Because Victoria MacElroy is not a man.    
So to be clear,     
you're not interested in making friends?    
What I'm interested in is in living long enough.    
to see women no longer treated like second-class citizens.    
Well if your goal is a long life.    
that chili cheeseburger is a step in the wrong direction.    
Food is all I have.
