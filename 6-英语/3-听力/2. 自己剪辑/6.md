George Junior.    
give me back that bowtie right now.    
I didn't take it,    
Don't you lie to me.    
I'm not lying.    
We'll see about that.    
Stay out of my room.    
she's gonna find your dirty magazines.    
Shut up.    
You are not having a good day.    
Hey, he didn't take it.    
Then what happened to it?     
Help me find my bowtie.        
I'll check in the bathroom.    
I took it.
