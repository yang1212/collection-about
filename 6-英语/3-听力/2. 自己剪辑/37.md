Here we go.    
15 years and 14 hours later.    
Best brisket in Texas.    
Connie, you evil bitch.    
It's smoother than regular coffee.    
That wasn't the recipe.    
You looked me in the eye, and you lied to me.    
Oh, Mom.    
You broke into my home and tried to steal it.    
Oh, George.    
You told her we went over there?    
Oh, George Jr.    
I didn't say nothing, I was cool.    
I am loving this.    
I don't want this woman in my house anymore.    
-She is my mother. -She is the devil.    
And what if the kids want to see her?    
Fine.    
Schedule it for when I'm not here.    
Or when I'm dead.    
And quit drinking my coffee.
