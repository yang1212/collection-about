And I wasn't eavesdropping.     
Don't worry about it.    
I just don't see why I got grounded.    
what are you complaining about?    
You didn't want to go to church picnic anyway.    
I like complaining, I'm good at it.    
I'll be right back.    
Mind if I have a sip of your beer?    
You mind if I dip your head into compost heap?    
You could have just said no.    
What are you doing?    
Nothing, Get out of here.    
You're looking for her brisket recipe.    
All of sudden you got smart?    
I said get out of here.    
I won't tell, I swear.    
All right, help me look.
