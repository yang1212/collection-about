What the hell were you thinking?      
That I was being chivalrous.     
By going behind my back?     
You seem upset.     
I am upset.     
And how I handle Ira is my business.     
Well, I hope you do it gently.     
He's very vulnerable these days.          
You're friends now?     
Well, I wouldn't say friends.     
but I could see, over time.     
you know, we might...     
Are you two fighting?     
No.     
Oh, good.     
I was almost certain that we were.     
We are.     
-I'm confused. -Me, too.     
Is this because you went to the furniture store?     
He knows about this?     
-Yes, -All right, now, listen.     
If this realtionship's gonna have any chance at all.     
we have to lay down some ground rules.     
Great. I love rules.     
I do, too.     
I don't want you talking to him about anything.     
having to do with anything about us.     
Same with you.          
And I want you to stop     
spying on me with those binoculars     
like you're on some kind of African safari.
