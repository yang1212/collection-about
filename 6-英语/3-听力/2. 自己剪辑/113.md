Why do grownups do this?　　  
They love to stick random kids together,　　  
and expect them to just be friends.　　  
I know.　　  
I hate that.　　  
Fresh Prince is right.　　  
Parents just don't understand.　　  
I love that song.　　  
I have a cassette of it.　　  
but I recorded it off the radio.　　  
You can hear Sheldon in the background　　  
saying stuff about Sir Isaac Neutron.　　  
Ugh, my sister's always talking about him.　　  
I don't know why.　　  
I think he's dead.　　  
You have no idea how much it sucks　　  
to have a brother like him.　　  
Believe it or not, he's in my class.　　  
My parents sent Paige to a private school.　　  
Cool, We're too poor for that.　　  
Does Sheldon make you feel stupid?　　  
Nah, I'm smart in other ways.　　  
Me, too.　　  
Hey, I saw an old TV in the alley.　　  
Want to go throw rocks at it?　　  
-Cool, -Hell yeah.　　  
Let's do it.
