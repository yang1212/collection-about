Sheldon, time to go.      
We really need to get one of these.     
What on earth do we need a computer for?     
Yeah, we got you and your big head.     
But we can get so much accomplished.     
I could use a spreadsheet program     
to keep track of your expenses.     
I do that in the back of my checkbook.     
Yes, but does your checkbook go "Beep" when you open it?     
I don't think so.     
Plus, the computer can organize your recipes.     
But my recipes are organized.     
On index cards.     
Like a cave person.     
Cave Mom. I'm gonna call you that.     
It doesn't matter, Sheldon.     
We can't afford a computer     
Sure we can. It's only $998.     
and Dave says we can buy it on easy monthly payments.     
That's true.     
Stay out of this, Dave.     
Come on.     
We got to get home.     
But...     
Sheldon, I said no.     
I can make you a good deal on the floor model, mrs. Cooper.     
Seriously, Dave, you're getting on my nerves.     
It's not fair.     
You bought Missy a Ring Pop.     
For ten cents.     
And I'm worth every penny.     
Let's go.
