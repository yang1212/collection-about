So, you're really gonna go out     
with this furniture store fella   
while seeing Dr.Sturgis?    
It's called playing the field.   
And if you'd done some of that.   
you wouldn't be saddled with Bluto in there.   
That's not nice.   
And is that really necessary?   
The Italians call it "Corretto".   
It means correcting the drink.   
So, a drink without alcohol in it is wrong?   
Yeah.   
Italian people, they know what's up.   
All right, one issue at a time.   
So, you're really gonna date two men simultaneously?   
Two that you know of.   
Oh, Mom.   
Come on, don't be such a prude.   
I'm not gonna have any babies.   
I don't need these men to take care of me.   
Why shouldn't I just enjoy myself?   
Well, it isn't very Christian of you.   
I got no argument there.   
Salute.   
Yeah, that fixed it.
