    
Now, since we'll be spending a few hours together,    
I've created a list of activities to keep us occupied.    
We'll start with a tour of my room,    
then board games, and, if time permits.    
you can look at and not touch my trains.    
Oh, My Little Pony.    
I love My Little Pony.    
That's my sister's, and it's not part of the tour.    
I share a room with my sister, too.    
It's super fun.    
You're wrong.    
Now, over here, we have my desk.    
This is my computer.    
That's my mouse.    
This is my printer, This is the paper that goes in the printer.    
This is box of extra paper.    
that also goes in the printer.    
And this is my signed picture of Professor Proton.    
Do you watch his show?    
No, I don't really like it.    
You don't?    
I think he's boring.    
And he dumbs everything down.    
Come on, Kolinahr, don't fail me now.    
And next on the tour, we have..    
a lamp.
