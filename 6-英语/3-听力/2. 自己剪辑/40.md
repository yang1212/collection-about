How do you know the recipe, Shelly?      
Meemaw told it to me on Valentine's Day, 1982.     
You were out with Dad saying Cannonball Run     
at the dollar theater.     
That's impossible, you weren't even 2 years old.     
Three tablespoons of dried mustard.     
one cup of Lone Star beer...     
Okay.     
Okay.     
Go ahead.     
Give it to your father.     
I can write it down for you.     
That's okay. I don't want it.     
You have got to be kidding me.     
Connie, you've had every opportunity     
to give me that recipe and you never did.     
because you've always treated me like an outsider.     
No, she has not.     
Oh, of course I have.     
See, She admits it.     
Damn right, I do.     
Never thought you were good enough for my daugher.     
There you were, riding around on that dumb motorcycle.     
knocking her up.     
Why don't you kids go in the kitchen.     
and fix yourself some ice cream?     
I'm not going anywhere.
