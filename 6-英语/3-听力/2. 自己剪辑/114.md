That's why we're getting together.　　  
you know, talk about this kind of stuff.　　  
Barry, it sounds like you might be feeling left out.　　  
Oh, no.　　  
Sometimes I do.　　  
And it's not just me, It's Erica, too.　　  
Oh, now he's just being dramatic.　　  
Erica gets a lot of attention.　　  
and she's just a joy.　　  
Dang it, the screen won't break.　　  
Bet it'll break if we blow it up.　　  
I love her.　　  
Fine, you're right.　　  
Erica's doing just great.　　  
Nothing to worry about there.　　  
Oh, come on.　　  
You got any matches?　　  
Be right back.　　  
Whils she's gone, you want to make out?　　  
Sure.
