I've decided to learn self-defense.      
-Why? -I'm quite small.      
and will be for several years,      
maybe even more if I'm a late bloomer.            
Your dad's big, maybe you'll take after him.      
We both like my mom.      
I think that's where the similarities end.      
You know, one of the books mentioned      
a Vietnames martial art.      
Vovinam, I'm a blue belt.      
Don't be impressed.      
It's what you get when your mom buys the uniform.      
Do you remember any of it?      
I don't even know where the belt is.      
The book says jiu-jitsu      
is based on using your attacker's momentum against them.      
It's just physics. Come at me.      
Like, run at you?      
Well, I'm new to this, so maybe just walk quickly.      
And what happens when I get to you?      
I'll use your inertia to take you down.      
Okay.
