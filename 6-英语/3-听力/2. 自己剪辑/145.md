Did you know that tea was discovered by accident?       
I didn't, but I don't know lots of stuff.      
The Emperor Shennong of China was boiling water in his garden      
and a leaf from a tea tree fell into his pot.      
Tea comes from trees?      
Where'd you think it comes from?      
The supermarket.      
What, the girls leave you out of their little picnic?      
Oh, they invited him.      
Well, then why ain't you out there?      
Eat outdoors? Do I look like a hippie to you?      
I thought Paige was your friend.      
She's more of a colleague.      
Although for reasons unknown.      
she's currently behaving like a ten-year-old.      
Maybe that's because she is a ten-year-old.      
Still no excuse.      
All right, I'm just gonna come out and ask it.      
what the heck is a colleague?
