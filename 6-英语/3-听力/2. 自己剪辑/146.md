I'm usually the one giving the tests,       
but, uh, today I'm taking one.       
No talking.       
And I usually say that to my students.       
What?       
How's it going?       
I can't tell you. There's no talking.       
-No talking. -Sorry.       
Mind if I join you?       
Doing what?       
-Swinging. -Seriously?       
Yes, It's my hope to feel the wind in my hair       
-and be carefree. -Um, okay.       
Sheldon threw up on me, Sheldon threw up on me.
