I can't believe you sent him to bed without his dinner.      
That's right.     
On spaghetti and hot dog night.     
-That's rough. -He's got to learn.     
Let's talk about something else.     
Georgie, how was your day?     
My brother told the entire school we can't afford cable.     
Oh, right.     
Missy?     
Good, until I learned we can't afford cable.     
I've been thinking, and there's something I'd like to say.     
Unless it's an apology, I don't want to hear it.     
I'm quitting science.     
Not an apology.     
Spank him, Dad.     
I'm really getting worried about Shelly.     
Acting out, and now quitting science?     
Oh, I'm sure he'll get right back to it.     
I've quit smoking and gambling plenty of times.     
Hmm, Look in my purse.     
Nothing but cigarettes and scratchers.     
Maybe he should talk to somebody.     
Not it.
