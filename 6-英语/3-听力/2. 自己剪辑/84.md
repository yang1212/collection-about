What are you doing?     
Confiscating your comic books.    
You can have them back when you're 18.    
You're taking Casper the Friendly Ghost?    
Ghosts are sacrilegious.    
Nothing friendly about that.    
Very well.    
There's one more book that belongs in the box.    
filled with adultery, genocide, and even human sacrifice.    
You think you're so smart.    
I do, And yet you continue to treat me like a child.    
You know what?    
You want me to treat you like an adult, you got it.    
From this moment on, I am doune mommy-ing you.    
Wonderful, Does that mean I can have my comic books back?    
Comic books are for children, You're an adult.
