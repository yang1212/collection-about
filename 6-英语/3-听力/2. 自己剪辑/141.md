All right, Tam.       
Well, based on your observations and hypothesis.      
were you able to make a prediction?      
Yes, At some point, my father would die prematurely from stress.      
And my mother will come live with me.      
where she will constantly disapprove      
of my hot, blond, American wife.      
Okay, Uh, I think we all learned something there.      
Uh, thank you, Tam.      
Uh, Mr Cooper, you're up.      
Beginning on Wednesday night, I observed my parents      
arguing over the possibility of us moving to Tulsa, Oklahoma.      
Ugh, Oklahoma.      
The argument escalated and then my father stormed out      
and bought a Fiero.      
and then I went to my Meemaw's      
and slept in my underwear.
