Over the next few days,         
I ran to my Meemaw's house.         
so we could save the 8-bit princess.         
And if it's unclear how important this was.         
let me say it again: I ran.         
Right behind you, monster, monster.         
I see him.         
You're losing life points, do something.         
Calm down, I'v got this.         
No, no, no. You're going to die.         
We're going to have to restart this level.         
Okay, we need to set a few ground rules.         
Rules, love'em.         
Mazes, puzzles, panic attacks,         
you're in charge.         
Whooping monster butt, that's my purview.         
Understood, However...         
Excuse me, Is there a monster on that screen?         
Yesï¼Œma'am.         
-And can two players swing the magic sword? -No.         
So what does that mean as we go forward?         
I have to shut my yap.         
Attaboy.         
Can I still have a panic attack?         
If you do it quietly.
