Sheldon?     
Yes.    
The door's locked. Can you open it?    
No.    
What on earth?    
-Hello, -What are you doing?    
I made a real germ-proof hedge of protection.    
Oh, honey, you can't stay in there.    
I've got a refrigerator, I've got my sleeping bag.    
and anything else I need I can make out of Legos.    
What's with the Halloween costume?    
In case of a breach.    
Stay right there.    
That's my plan.    
George?    
Just when you think he's gonna zig.    
you get a big old zag.
