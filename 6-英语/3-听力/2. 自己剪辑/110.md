I'm the youngest person in this class.       
That's funny.       
Oh, good.       
I see you two have met.       
I'm younger than him.       
How come you never mentioned she was coming to this class?       
I thought it would be a fun surprise.       
I don't like surprise.       
Neither do I.       
Then why did you do it?       
Some people like surprises.       
I love surprises.       
Did you enjoy this one?       
-Yes. -A 50% success rate.
