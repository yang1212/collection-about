Whoa, pace yourself, cowgirl.　　  
I'm fine.　　  
Are we gonna shoot pool or not?　　  
You bet.　　  
Did you know George and I used to come here　　  
when we first started dating?　　  
Is that so?　　  
He kissed me right over there in that booth.　　  
Why, was there some barbecue sauce on your face?　　
It's a fat joke.　　  
I got it, Mom.　　  
Come on, Come on.　　  
Why are you putting us to bed?　　  
Because your mother's out.　　  
Where is she?　　  
She's with your grandmother.　　  
-Where'd they go? -I don't know.　　  
Why don't you know? -Because I'm here with you.　　 
Good night, Sweet dreams.　　  
Mom gives us kisses.　　  
Fine.　　  
Mm, your beard is scratchy.　　  
Too bad, Sheldon?　　  
I respectfully pass.
