Mom, have you received any distressing phone calls today?　　  
No, why?　　  
Just wondering if it's an appropriate time　　  
to ask if you could take me to Radio Shack.　　  
Sorry. sweetheart, I can't today.　　  
I have to bring this food over to the Hanson family.　　  
Then I have my new prayer group.　　  
And after that, I'm gonna get started　　  
on a faith garden in the backyard.　　  
A faith garden? What the hell is that?　　  
Language.　　  
It's an outdoorsy place for me to speak to God.　　  
Don't you already speak to him indoorsy?　　  
Yes, but in the backyard.　　  
I can enjoy the beautiful world he gave us.　　  
You can also smell the Sparks' chicken coop.　　  
Well, I think it sounds nice.　　  
Thank you, I'm gonna need your truck　　  
to get all the dirt and flowers and tools that I need.　　  
-Sure, -Oh, oh, almost forgot.　　  
Can you keep an eye out for a rock big enough　　  
to paint a Psalm on?　　  
I can do that.　　  
Wish me luck.　　  
Luck.　　  
Is Mom okay?　　  
How the heck should I know?　　  
She left, you can say "Hell".
