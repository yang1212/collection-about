My mother managed to locate a family psychiatrist,     
within our price range.     
No one seemed to be bothered that he had,     
a coupon in The Pennysaver.     
Is this man gonna make me eat solid foods?     
No, he just wants to talk to you about it.     
Did you tell him I have a lot to accomplish in my life,     
and cannot afford to be killed by an unchewed sausage?     
Not in those exact words.     
Did you bring the coupon?     
Hi, welcome.     
You must be the Cooper Family.     
We are.     
Right on, right on.     
This must be Sheldon.     
Put'er there.     
No, thank you.     
Right on, right on.     
Okay, well, here's how I'd like to start, Mom and Dad,     
why don't you come talk to me first and then Sheldon.     
you and I have a little rap session.
