You dirty bird.     
What are you doing in here?     
You cheated.     
No, I didn't.     
I'm holding the evidence.     
Let me see that.     
I don't see nothing.     
That's obstruction of justice.     
as well as disgusting.     
Oh, relax. By passing that test, I get to play football,     
and you get to go to the train store.     
Everybody wins.     
But what about the truth?     
What about it?     
It's supposed to set us free.     
Who told you that?     
The Bible.     
Since when do you care about what's in the Bible?     
When it helps me win an argument.     
The Bible also says honor thy father and thy mother.     
And if you open your mouth, you're gonna make them sad.     
He had me.     
Somehow, the mullet-headed simpleton had me.     
This isn't over.
