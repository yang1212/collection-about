You know how you think I can't do anything for myself?      
I do think that, yes.     
Well, I have something I'd like to show you.     
You did some chores?     
Come see for yourself.     
I don't know if I'm ready for another heart attack.     
but here we go.     
Feast your eyes.          
You did all this?     
I did.     
You shoved everything in the closet, didn't you?     
Take a look.     
I'm impressed.     
You should be.     
There may be hope for you yet.
