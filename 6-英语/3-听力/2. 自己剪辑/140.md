Ohï¼Œdear.        
Don't be scared, Sheldon, it's just a parade.       
I already don't like dogs.       
Gigantic and floating does not help.       
-Hey, how's the parade?  -Great.       
Alf is one of the hosts.       
Alf, cool, Hey, so listen.       
how attached are you to living here in Medford?       
I don't know what that means.       
If we moved away,       
do you have really good friends that you'd miss a lot?       
I have really good friends.       
but I think they would mostly miss me.       
because you make friends wherever you go.       
I do, People are drawn to me.       
Sorry,  I'm neutral.       
Okay, so what I'm hearing is that       
you'd be happy no matter where we lived.       
I guess, Dad, please, I'm trying to watch TV.       
Sorry, I'll leave you to it.       
Oh dear, Big Bird.
