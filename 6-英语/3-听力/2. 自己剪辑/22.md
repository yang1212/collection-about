I have a special treat for y'all today.     
My deer friend and former college roommate is here     
from the Johnson Space Center in Houston     
to talk to us about our space program.     
And yeah, I know what you're thinking.     
These guys were roomies.     
How does one go on to be a..     
a fancy scientist at NASA.     
and the other's teaching freshman science     
at a public high school?     
Yeah, Sheldon.     
I was thinking that.     
Thank you.     
All right, uh, let's give a warm welcome.     
to my good buddy, Dr.Ronald Hodges.     
Hey, kids, Hey, Glad to be here.     
And, uh, Hubert, the answer to your question is,     
one of those roomies was busy studying,     
while the other was out chasing high school girls.     
Yeah.
